============================

.. include:: ../../links.rst

This guide will be a walkthrough related to how to add new services to a TripleO
deployment through additions to the tripleo-heat-templates and puppet-tripleo
repositories, using part of the architecture defined in the `composable services architecture`_.

.. note::

  No puppet manifests may be defined in the `THT repository`_, they
  should go to the `puppet-tripleo repository`_ instead.
