Security Hardening
==================

TripleO can deploy Overcloud nodes with various Security Hardening values
passed in as environment files to the ``openstack overcloud deploy`` command.

Horizon Password Validation
---------------------------

Horizon provides a password validation check which OpenStack cloud operators
can use to enforce password complexity.

Regular expression can be used for password validation with help text to display
if the users password does not adhere with validation checks.

The following example will enforce users to create a password between 8 and 18
characters in length::

    parameter_defaults:
      HorizonPasswordValidator: '^.{8,18}$'
      HorizonPasswordValidatorHelp: 'Password must be between 8 and 18 characters.'

If the above yaml was saved as ``horizon_password.yaml`` we can then pass this
into the overcloud deploy command as follows::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e  horizon_password.yaml

Default Security Values in Horzion
----------------------------------

The following config directives are set to ``True`` as a secure default, however
if a reason exists for an operator to disable one of the following values, they
can do so using an enviroment file.

.. note:: The following directives should only be set to ``False`` once the
          potential security impacts are fully understood.

Enforce Password Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By setting ``ENFORCE_PASSWORD_CHECK`` to ``True`` within Horizon's
``local_settings.py``, it displays an ‘Admin Password’ field on the
“Change Password” form to verify that it is the admin loggedin that wants to
perform the password change.

If a need is present to disable ``ENFORCE_PASSWORD_CHECK`` then this can be
achieved using an environment file contain the following parameter::

    parameter_defaults:
      ControllerExtraConfig:
        horizon::enforce_password_check: false

Disallow Iframe Embed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DISALLOW_IFRAME_EMBED can be used to prevent Horizon from being embedded within
an iframe. Legacy browsers are still vulnerable to a Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS)
vulnerability, so this option allows extra security hardening where iframes are
not used in deployment.

If however a reason exists to allow Iframe embedding, then the following
parameter can be set within an enviroment file::

    parameter_defaults:
      ControllerExtraConfig:
        horizon::disallow_iframe_embed: false

Disable Password Reveal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the same way as ``ENFORCE_PASSWORD_CHECK`` and ``DISALLOW_IFRAME_EMBED`` the
``DISABLE_PASSWORD_REVEAL`` value to be toggled as a parameter::

    parameter_defaults:
      ControllerExtraConfig:
        horizon::disable_password_reveal: false

SSH Banner Text
---------------

SSH ``/etc/issue`` Banner text can be set using the following parameters in an
enviroment file::

    resource_registry:
      OS::TripleO::Services::Sshd: ../puppet/services/sshd.yaml

    parameter_defaults:
      BannerText: |
        ******************************************************************
        * This system is for the use of authorized users only. Usage of  *
        * this system may be monitored and recorded by system personnel. *
        * Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring *
        * and is advised that if such monitoring reveals possible        *
        * evidence of criminal activity, system personnel may provide    *
        * the evidence from such monitoring to law enforcement officials.*
        ******************************************************************

As with the previous Horizon Password Validation example, saving the above into
a yaml file, will allow passing the aforementioned parameters into the overcloud
deploy command::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e  ssh_banner.yaml

Audit
-----

Having a system capable of recording all audit events is key for troubleshooting
and peforming analysis of events that led to a certain outcome. The audit system
is capable of logging many events such as someone changing the system time,
changes to Mandatory / Discretionary Access Control, creating / destroying users
or groups.

Rules can be declared using an enviroment file and injected into
``/etc/audit/audit.rules``::

    parameter_defaults:
      AuditdRules:
        'Record Events that Modify User/Group Information':
          content: '-w /etc/group -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification'
          order  : 1
        'Collects System Administrator Actions':
          content: '-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k actions'
          order  : 2
        'Record Events that Modify the Systems Mandatory Access Controls':
          content: '-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy'
          order  : 3
