<p class="last">The code contains explicit checks during transitions using the models
described below. These checks ensure that a transition is valid, if the
transition is determined to be invalid the transitioning code will raise
a <a class="reference internal" href="exceptions.html#taskflow.exceptions.InvalidState" title="taskflow.exceptions.InvalidState"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">InvalidState</span></code></a> exception. This exception
being triggered usually means there is some kind of bug in the code or some
type of misuse/state violation is occurring, and should be reported as such.</p>

<h2>Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/flow_states.svg"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="Flow state transitions" src="_images/flow_states.svg" width="660px" /></div>
</a>
<p><strong>PENDING</strong> - A flow starts (or
via <a class="reference internal" href="engines.html#taskflow.engines.base.Engine.reset" title="taskflow.engines.base.Engine.reset"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">reset()</span></code></a>) its execution lifecycle
in this state (it has no state prior to being ran by an engine, since
flow(s) are just pattern(s) that define the semantics and ordering of their
contents and flows gain state only when they are executed).</p>
<p><strong>RUNNING</strong> - In this state the engine running a flow progresses through the
flow.</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS</strong> - Transitioned to once all of the flows atoms have finished
successfully.</p>
<p><strong>REVERTED</strong> - Transitioned to once all of the flows atoms have been reverted
successfully after a failure.</p>
<p><strong>FAILURE</strong> - The engine will transition the flow to this state when it can not
be reverted after a single failure or after multiple failures (greater than
one failure <em>may</em> occur when running in parallel).</p>
<p><strong>SUSPENDING</strong> - In the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RUNNING</span></code> state the engine running the flow can be
suspended. When this happens, the engine attempts to transition the flow
to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUSPENDING</span></code> state immediately. In that state the engine running the
flow waits for running atoms to finish (since the engine can not preempt
atoms that are actively running).</p>
<p><strong>SUSPENDED</strong> - When no atoms are running and all results received so far have
been saved, the engine transitions the flow from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUSPENDING</span></code> state
to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUSPENDED</span></code> state.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The engine may transition the flow to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUCCESS</span></code> state (from the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUSPENDING</span></code> state) if all atoms were in fact running (and completed)
before the suspension request was able to be honored (this is due to the lack
of preemption) or to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REVERTED</span></code> state if the engine was reverting and
all atoms were reverted while the engine was waiting for running atoms to
finish or to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FAILURE</span></code> state if atoms were running or reverted and
some of them had failed.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>RESUMING</strong> - When the engine running a flow is interrupted <em>&#8216;in a
hard way&#8217;</em> (e.g. server crashed), it can be loaded from storage in <em>any</em>
state (this is required since it is can not be known what state was last
successfully saved). If the loaded state is not <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PENDING</span></code> (aka, the flow was
never ran) or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUCCESS</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FAILURE</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REVERTED</span></code> (in which case the flow
has already finished), the flow gets set to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RESUMING</span></code> state for the
short time period while it is being loaded from backend storage [a database, a
filesystem...] (this transition is not shown on the diagram). When the flow is
finally loaded, it goes to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUSPENDED</span></code> state.</p>
<p>From the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SUCCESS</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FAILURE</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REVERTED</span></code> states the flow can be ran
again; therefore it is allowable to go back into the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RUNNING</span></code> state
immediately. One of the possible use cases for this transition is to allow for
alteration of a flow or flow details associated with a previously ran flow
after the flow has finished, and client code wants to ensure that each atom
from this new (potentially updated) flow has its chance to run.</p>

<div class="section" id="task">
<h2>Task<a class="headerlink" href="#task" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

</a>
<p><strong>PENDING</strong> - A task starts its execution lifecycle in this state (it has no
state prior to being ran by an engine, since tasks(s) are just objects that
represent how to accomplish a piece of work). Once it has been transitioned to
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PENDING</span></code> state by the engine this means it can be executed immediately
or if needed will wait for all of the atoms it depends on to complete.</p>

execute) the task the engine will transition the task to
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">IGNORE</span></code> state.</p>
<p><strong>RUNNING</strong> - When an engine running the task starts to execute the task, the

<p><strong>PENDING</strong> - A retry starts its execution lifecycle in this state (it has no

<p><strong>UNCLAIMED</strong> - A job (with details about what work is to be completed) has
been initially posted (by some posting entity) for work on by some other
entity (for example a <a class="reference internal" href="conductors.html"><em>conductor</em></a>). This can also be a state

lost ownership of) a previously claimed job.</p>
<p><strong>CLAIMED</strong> - A job that is <em>actively</em> owned by some entity; typically that
ownership is tied to jobs persistent data via some ephemeral connection so
that the job ownership is lost (typically automatically or after some
timeout) if that ephemeral connection is lost.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLETE</strong> - The work defined in the job has been finished by its owning
entity and the job can no longer be processed (and it <em>may</em> be removed at
some/any point in the future).</p>
