<h1>Upgrading Keystone<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-keystone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As of the Newton release, keystone supports two different approaches to
upgrading across releases. The traditional approach requires a significant
outage to be scheduled for the entire duration of the upgrade process. The more
modern approach results in zero downtime, but is more complicated due to a
longer upgrade procedure.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The details of these steps are entirely dependent on the details of your
specific deployment, such as your chosen application server and database

</div>
<div class="section" id="before-you-begin">
<h2>Before you begin<a class="headerlink" href="#before-you-begin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Plan your upgrade:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Read and ensure you understand the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/keystone/">release notes</a> for the next release.</li>
<li>Resolve any outstanding deprecation warnings in your logs. Some deprecation
cycles are as short as a single release, so it&#8217;s possible to break a
deployment if you leave <em>any</em> outstanding warnings. It might be a good idea
to re-read the release notes for the previous release (or two!).</li>
<li>Prepare your new configuration files, including <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keystone.conf</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">logging.conf</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">policy.json</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keystone-paste.ini</span></code>, and anything else

With keystone unavailable, no other OpenStack services will be able to
authenticate requests, effectively preventing the rest of the control plane
from functioning normally.</p>

<div class="section" id="upgrading-with-minimal-downtime">
<h2>Upgrading with minimal downtime<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-with-minimal-downtime" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you run a multi-node keystone cluster that uses a replicated database, like
a Galera cluster, it is possible to upgrade with minimal downtime. This method
also optimizes recovery time from a failed upgrade. This section assumes
familiarity with the base case (<a class="reference internal" href="#upgrading-with-downtime">Upgrading with downtime</a>) outlined above.
In these steps the nodes will be divided into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">other</span></code> nodes.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Backup your database. There is no way to rollback the upgrade of keystone
and this is your worst-case fallback option.</li>
<li>Disable keystone on all nodes but the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first</span></code> node. This can be done via a
variety of mechanisms that will depend on the deployment. If you are unable
to disable a service or place a service into maintenance mode in your load
balancer, you can stop the keystone processes.</li>
<li>Stop the database service on one of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">other</span></code> nodes in the cluster. This
will isolate the old dataset on a single node in the cluster. In the event
of a failed update this data can be used to rebuild the cluster without
having to restore from backup.</li>
<li>Update the configuration files on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first</span></code> node.</li>
<li>Upgrade keystone on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first</span></code> node. keystone is now down for your cloud.</li>
<li>Run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keystone-manage</span> <span class="pre">db_sync</span></code> on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first</span></code> node. As soon as this
finishes, keystone is now working again on a single node in the cluster.</li>
<li>keystone is now upgraded on a single node. Your load balancers will be
sending all traffic to this single node. This is your chance to run
ensure keystone up and running, and not broken. If keystone is broken, see
the <a class="reference internal" href="#rollback-after-a-failed-upgrade">Rollback after a failed upgrade</a> section below.</li>
<li>Once you have verified that keystone is up and running, begin the upgrade on
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">other</span></code> nodes. This entails updating configuration files and upgrading
the code. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db_sync</span></code> does not need to be run again.</li>
<li>On the node where you stopped the database service, be sure to restart
it and ensure that it properly rejoins the cluster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this model, the outage window is minimized because the only time
when your cluster is totally offline is between loading the newer version
of keystone and running the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">db_sync</span></code> command. Typically the outage with
this method can be measured in tens of seconds especially if automation is
used.</p>
<div class="section" id="rollback-after-a-failed-upgrade">
<h3>Rollback after a failed upgrade<a class="headerlink" href="#rollback-after-a-failed-upgrade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the upgrade fails, only a single node has been affected. This makes the
recovery simpler and quicker. If issues are not discovered until the entire
cluster is upgraded, a full shutdown and restore from backup will be required.
That will take much longer than just fixing a single node with an old copy of
the database still available. This process will be dependent on your
architecture and it is highly recommended that you&#8217;ve practiced this in a
development environment before trying to use it for the first time.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Isolate the bad node. Shutdown keystone and the database services
on the upgraded &#8220;bad&#8221; node.</li>
<li>Bootstrap the database cluster from the node holding the old data.
This may require wiping the data first on any nodes who are not
holding old data.</li>
<li>Enable keystone on the old nodes in your load balancer or if
the processes were stopped, restart them.</li>
<li>Validate that keystone is working.</li>
<li>Downgrade the code and config files on the bad node.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process should be doable in a matter of minutes and will minimize cloud
downtime if it is required.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">For MySQL, using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keystone-manage</span> <span class="pre">db_sync</span> <span class="pre">--expand</span></code> command requires

normally.</p>

schema and the old schema, so both the previous release and the next release
will be capable of operating normally.</p>
