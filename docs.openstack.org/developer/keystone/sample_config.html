<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># From keystone</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="c1"># Using this feature is *NOT* recommended. Instead, use the `keystone-manage</span>
<span class="c1"># bootstrap` command. The value of this option is treated as a &quot;shared secret&quot;</span>
<span class="c1"># that can be used to bootstrap Keystone through the API. This &quot;token&quot; does not</span>
<span class="c1"># represent a user (it has no identity), and carries no explicit authorization</span>
<span class="c1"># (it effectively bypasses most authorization checks). If set to `None`, the</span>
<span class="c1"># value is ignored and the `admin_token` middleware is effectively disabled.</span>
<span class="c1"># However, to completely disable `admin_token` in production (highly</span>
<span class="c1"># recommended, as it presents a security risk), remove</span>
<span class="c1"># `AdminTokenAuthMiddleware` (the `admin_token_auth` filter) from your paste</span>
<span class="c1"># application pipelines (for example, in `keystone-paste.ini`). (string value)</span>
<span class="c1">#admin_token = &lt;None&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># The base public endpoint URL for Keystone that is advertised to clients</span>
<span class="c1"># (NOTE: this does NOT affect how Keystone listens for connections). Defaults</span>
<span class="c1"># to the base host URL of the request. For example, if keystone receives a</span>
<span class="c1"># request to `http://server:5000/v3/users`, then this will option will be</span>
<span class="c1"># automatically treated as `http://server:5000`. You should only need to set</span>
<span class="c1"># option if either the value of the base URL contains a path that keystone does</span>
<span class="c1"># not automatically infer (`/prefix/v3`), or if the endpoint should be found on</span>
<span class="c1"># a different host. (uri value)</span>
<span class="c1">#public_endpoint = &lt;None&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># The base admin endpoint URL for Keystone that is advertised to clients (NOTE:</span>
<span class="c1"># this does NOT affect how Keystone listens for connections). Defaults to the</span>
<span class="c1"># base host URL of the request. For example, if keystone receives a request to</span>
<span class="c1"># `http://server:35357/v3/users`, then this will option will be automatically</span>
<span class="c1"># treated as `http://server:35357`. You should only need to set option if</span>
<span class="c1"># either the value of the base URL contains a path that keystone does not</span>
<span class="c1"># automatically infer (`/prefix/v3`), or if the endpoint should be found on a</span>
<span class="c1"># different host. (uri value)</span>
<span class="c1">#admin_endpoint = &lt;None&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># Maximum depth of the project hierarchy, excluding the project acting as a</span>
<span class="c1"># domain at the top of the hierarchy. WARNING: Setting it to a large value may</span>
<span class="c1"># adversely impact performance. (integer value)</span>
<span class="c1">#max_project_tree_depth = 5</span>

<span class="c1"># Limit the sizes of user &amp; project ID/names. (integer value)</span>
<span class="c1">#max_param_size = 64</span>

<span class="c1"># Similar to `[DEFAULT] max_param_size`, but provides an exception for token</span>
<span class="c1"># values. With Fernet tokens, this can be set as low as 255. With UUID tokens,</span>
<span class="c1"># this should be set to 32). (integer value)</span>
<span class="c1">#max_token_size = 255</span>

<span class="c1"># Similar to the `[DEFAULT] member_role_name` option, this represents the</span>
<span class="c1"># default role ID used to associate users with their default projects in the v2</span>
<span class="c1"># API. This will be used as the explicit role where one is not specified by the</span>
<span class="c1"># v2 API. You do not need to set this value unless you want keystone to use an</span>
<span class="c1"># existing role with a different ID, other than the arbitrarily defined</span>
<span class="c1"># `_member_` role (in which case, you should set `[DEFAULT] member_role_name`</span>
<span class="c1"># as well). (string value)</span>
<span class="c1">#member_role_id = 9fe2ff9ee4384b1894a90878d3e92bab</span>

<span class="c1"># This is the role name used in combination with the `[DEFAULT] member_role_id`</span>
<span class="c1"># option; see that option for more detail. You do not need to set this option</span>
<span class="c1"># unless you want keystone to use an existing role (in which case, you should</span>
<span class="c1"># set `[DEFAULT] member_role_id` as well). (string value)</span>
<span class="c1">#member_role_name = _member_</span>

<span class="c1"># The value passed as the keyword &quot;rounds&quot; to passlib&#39;s encrypt method. This</span>
<span class="c1"># option represents a trade off between security and performance. Higher values</span>
<span class="c1"># lead to slower performance, but higher security. Changing this option will</span>
<span class="c1"># only affect newly created passwords as existing password hashes already have</span>
<span class="c1"># a fixed number of rounds applied, so it is safe to tune this option in a</span>
<span class="c1"># running cluster. For more information, see</span>
<span class="c1"># https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/password_hash_api.html#choosing-the-right-</span>
<span class="c1"># rounds-value (integer value)</span>
<span class="c1"># Minimum value: 1000</span>
<span class="c1"># Maximum value: 100000</span>
<span class="c1">#crypt_strength = 10000</span>

<span class="c1"># The maximum number of entities that will be returned in a collection. This</span>
<span class="c1"># global limit may be then overridden for a specific driver, by specifying a</span>
<span class="c1"># list_limit in the appropriate section (for example, `[assignment]`). No limit</span>
<span class="c1"># is set by default. In larger deployments, it is recommended that you set this</span>
<span class="c1"># to a reasonable number to prevent operations like listing all users and</span>
<span class="c1"># projects from placing an unnecessary load on the system. (integer value)</span>
<span class="c1">#list_limit = &lt;None&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># If set to true, strict password length checking is performed for password</span>
<span class="c1"># manipulation. If a password exceeds the maximum length, the operation will</span>
<span class="c1"># fail with an HTTP 403 Forbidden error. If set to false, passwords are</span>
<span class="c1"># automatically truncated to the maximum length. (boolean value)</span>
<span class="c1">#strict_password_check = false</span>

<span class="c1"># DEPRECATED: The HTTP header used to determine the scheme for the original</span>
<span class="c1"># request, even if it was removed by an SSL terminating proxy. (string value)</span>
<span class="c1"># This option is deprecated for removal since N.</span>
<span class="c1"># Its value may be silently ignored in the future.</span>
<span class="c1"># Reason: This option has been deprecated in the N release and will be removed</span>
<span class="c1"># in the P release. Use oslo.middleware.http_proxy_to_wsgi configuration</span>
<span class="c1"># instead.</span>
<span class="c1">#secure_proxy_ssl_header = HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO</span>

<span class="c1"># If set to true, then the server will return information in HTTP responses</span>
<span class="c1"># that may allow an unauthenticated or authenticated user to get more</span>
<span class="c1"># information than normal, such as additional details about why authentication</span>
<span class="c1"># failed. This may be useful for debugging but is insecure. (boolean value)</span>
<span class="c1">#insecure_debug = false</span>

<span class="c1"># Default `publisher_id` for outgoing notifications. If left undefined,</span>
<span class="c1"># Keystone will default to using the server&#39;s host name. (string value)</span>
<span class="c1">#default_publisher_id = &lt;None&gt;</span>

<span class="c1"># Define the notification format for identity service events. A `basic`</span>
<span class="c1"># notification only has information about the resource being operated on. A</span>
<span class="c1"># `cadf` notification has the same information, as well as information about</span>
<span class="c1"># the initiator of the event. The `cadf` option is entirely backwards</span>
<span class="c1"># compatible with the `basic` option, but is fully CADF-compliant, and is</span>
<span class="c1"># recommended for auditing use cases. (string value)</span>
<span class="c1"># Allowed values: basic, cadf</span>
<span class="c1">#notification_format = cadf</span>

<span class="c1"># You can reduce the number of notifications keystone emits by explicitly</span>
<span class="c1"># opting out. Keystone will not emit notifications that match the patterns</span>
<span class="c1"># expressed in this list. Values are expected to be in the form of</span>
<span class="c1"># `identity.&lt;resource_type&gt;.&lt;operation&gt;`. By default, all notifications related</span>
<span class="c1"># to authentication are automatically suppressed. This field can be set</span>
<span class="c1"># multiple times in order to opt-out of multiple notification topics. For</span>
<span class="c1"># example, the following suppresses notifications describing user creation or</span>
<span class="c1"># successful authentication events: notification_opt_out=identity.user.create</span>
<span class="c1"># notification_opt_out=identity.authenticate.success (multi valued)</span>
<span class="c1">#notification_opt_out = identity.authenticate.success</span>
<span class="c1">#notification_opt_out = identity.authenticate.pending</span>
<span class="c1">#notification_opt_out = identity.authenticate.failed</span>

<span class="c1"># DEPRECATED: If set to false, the logging level will be set to WARNING instead</span>
