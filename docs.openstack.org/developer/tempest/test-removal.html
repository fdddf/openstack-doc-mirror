<h1>Tempest Test Removal Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#tempest-test-removal-procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Historically tempest was the only way of doing functional testing and
integration testing in OpenStack. This was mostly only an artifact of tempest
being the only proven pattern for doing this, not an artifact of a design
decision. However, moving forward as functional testing is being spun up in
each individual project we really only want tempest to be the integration test
suite it was intended to be; testing the high level interactions between
projects through REST API requests. In this model there are probably existing
tests that aren't the best fit living in tempest. However, since tempest is
largely still the only gating test suite in this space we can't carelessly rip
out everything from the tree. This document outlines the procedure which was
developed to ensure we minimize the risk for removing something of value from
the tempest tree.</p>
<p>This procedure might seem overly conservative and slow paced, but this is by
design to try and ensure we don't remove something that is actually providing
value. Having potential duplication between testing is not a big deal
especially compared to the alternative of removing something which is actually
providing value and is actively catching bugs, or blocking incorrect patches
from landing.</p>
<div class="section" id="proposing-a-test-removal">
<h2>Proposing a test removal<a class="headerlink" href="#proposing-a-test-removal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="prong-rule-for-removal">
<h3>3 prong rule for removal<a class="headerlink" href="#prong-rule-for-removal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the proposal etherpad we'll be looking for answers to 3 questions</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The tests proposed for removal must have equiv. coverage in a different
project's test suite (whether this is another gating test project, or an in
tree functional test suite). For API tests preferably the other project will
have a similar source of friction in place to prevent breaking api changes
so that we don't regress and let breaking api changes slip through the
gate.</li>
<li>The test proposed for removal has a failure rate &lt;  0.50% in the gate over
the past release (the value and interval will likely be adjusted in the
future)</li>
<li>There must not be an external user/consumer of tempest that depends on the
test proposed for removal</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The answers to 1 and 2 are easy to verify. For 1 just provide a link to the new
test location. If you are linking to the tempest removal patch please also put
a Depends-On in the commit message for the commit which moved the test into
another repo.</p>
<p>For prong 2 you can use OpenStack-Health:</p>
<div class="section" id="using-openstack-health">
<h4>Using OpenStack-Health<a class="headerlink" href="#using-openstack-health" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Go to: <a class="reference external" href="http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health">http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health</a> and then navigate to a per
test page for six months. You'll end up with a page that will graph the success
and failure rates on the bottom graph. For example, something like <a class="reference external" href="http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/test/tempest.scenario.test_volume_boot_pattern.TestVolumeBootPatternV2.test_volume_boot_pattern?groupKey=project&amp;resolutionKey=day&amp;duration=P6M">this URL</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-old-way-using-subunit2sql-directly">
<h4>The Old Way using subunit2sql directly<a class="headerlink" href="#the-old-way-using-subunit2sql-directly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>SELECT * from tests where test_id like &quot;%test_id%&quot;;
(where $test_id is the full test_id, but truncated to the class because of
setupClass or tearDownClass failures)</p>
<p>You can access the infra mysql subunit2sql db w/ read-only permissions with:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>hostname: logstash.openstack.org</li>
<li>username: query</li>
<li>password: query</li>
<li>db_name: subunit2sql</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For example if you were trying to remove the test with the id:
tempest.api.compute.admin.test_flavors_negative.FlavorsAdminNegativeTestJSON.test_get_flavor_details_for_deleted_flavor
you would run the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>run: &quot;mysql -u query -p -h logstash.openstack.org subunit2sql&quot; to connect
to the subunit2sql db</li>
<li>run the query: MySQL [subunit2sql]&gt; select * from tests where test_id like
&quot;tempest.api.compute.admin.test_flavors_negative.FlavorsAdminNegativeTestJSON%&quot;;
which will return a table of all the tests in the class (but it will also
catch failures in setupClass and tearDownClass)</li>
<li>paste the output table with numbers and the mysql command you ran to
generate it into the etherpad.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Eventually a cli interface will be created to make that a bit more friendly.
Also a dashboard is in the works so we don't need to manually run the command.</p>
<p>The intent of the 2nd prong is to verify that moving the test into a project
specific testing is preventing bugs (assuming the tempest tests were catching
issues) from bubbling up a layer into tempest jobs. If we're seeing failure
rates above a certain threshold in the gate checks that means the functional
testing isn't really being effective in catching that bug (and therefore
blocking it from landing) and having the testing run in tempest still has
value.</p>
<p>However for the 3rd prong verification is a bit more subjective. The original
intent of this prong was mostly for refstack/defcore and also for things that
running on the stable branches. We don't want to remove any tests if that
would break our api consistency checking between releases, or something that
defcore/refstack is depending on being in tempest. It's worth pointing out
that if a test is used in defcore as part of interop testing then it will
probably have continuing value being in tempest as part of the
integration/integrated tests in general. This is one area where some overlap
is expected between testing in projects and tempest, which is not a bad thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discussing-the-3rd-prong">
<h4>Discussing the 3rd prong<a class="headerlink" href="#discussing-the-3rd-prong" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are 2 approaches to addressing the 3rd prong. Either it can be raised
during a qa meeting during the tempest discussion. Please put it on the agenda
well ahead of the scheduled meeting. Since the meeting time will be well known
ahead of time anyone who depends on the tests will have ample time beforehand
to outline any concerns on the before the meeting. To give ample time for
people to respond to removal proposals please add things to the agenda by the
Monday before the meeting.</p>
<p>The other option is to raise the removal on the openstack-dev mailing list.
(for example see: <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-February/086218.html">http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-February/086218.html</a> )
This will raise the issue to the wider community and attract at least the same
(most likely more) attention than discussing it during the irc meeting. The
only downside is that it might take more time to get a response, given the
nature of ML.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exceptions-to-this-procedure">
<h2>Exceptions to this procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#exceptions-to-this-procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the most part all tempest test removals have to go through this procedure
there are a couple of exceptions though:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The class of testing has been decided to be outside the scope of tempest.</li>
<li>A revert for a patch which added a broken test, or testing which didn't
actually run in the gate (basically any revert for something which
shouldn't have been added)</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For the first exception type the only types of testing in tree which have been
declared out of scope at this point are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The CLI tests (which should be completely removed at this point)</li>
<li>Neutron Adv. Services testing (which should be completely removed at this
point)</li>
<li>XML API Tests (which should be completely removed at this point)</li>
<li>EC2 API/boto tests (which should be completely removed at this point)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For tests that fit into this category the only criteria for removal is that
there is equivalent testing elsewhere.</p>
<div class="section" id="tempest-scope">
<h3>Tempest Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#tempest-scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Also starting in the liberty cycle tempest has defined a set of projects which
are defined as in scope for direct testing in tempest. As of today that list
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Keystone</li>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>Glance</li>
<li>Cinder</li>
<li>Neutron</li>
<li>Swift</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>anything that lives in tempest which doesn't test one of these projects can be
removed assuming there is equivalent testing elsewhere. Preferably using the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tempest/plugin.html">tempest plugin mechanism</a>
to maintain continuity after migrating the tests out of tempest.</p>
