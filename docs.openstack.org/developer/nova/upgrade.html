<h1>Upgrades<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Nova aims to provide upgrades with minimal downtime.</p>
<p>Firstly, the data plane. There should be no VM downtime when you upgrade
Nova. Nova has had this since the early days, with the exception of
some nova-network related services.</p>
<p>Secondly, we want no downtime during upgrades of the Nova control plane.
This document is trying to describe how we can achieve that.</p>
<p>Once we have introduced the key concepts relating to upgrade, we will
introduce the process needed for a no downtime upgrade of nova.</p>
<div class="section" id="minimal-downtime-upgrade-process">
<h2>Minimal Downtime Upgrade Process<a class="headerlink" href="#minimal-downtime-upgrade-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="plan-your-upgrade">
<h3>Plan your upgrade<a class="headerlink" href="#plan-your-upgrade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Read and ensure you understand the release notes for the next release.</li>
<li>You should ensure all required steps from the previous upgrade have been
completed, such as data migrations.</li>
<li>Make a backup of your database. Nova does not support downgrading of the
database. Hence, in case of upgrade failure, restoring database from backup
is the only choice.</li>
<li>During upgrade be aware that there will be additional load on nova-conductor.
You may find you need to add extra nova-conductor workers to deal with the
additional upgrade related load.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rolling-upgrade-process">
<h3>Rolling upgrade process<a class="headerlink" href="#rolling-upgrade-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To reduce downtime, the compute services can be upgraded in a rolling fashion. It
means upgrading a few services at a time. This results in a condition where
both old (N) and new (N+1) nova-compute services co-exist for a certain time
period. Note that, there is no upgrade of the hypervisor here, this is just
upgrading the nova services. If reduced downtime is not a concern (or lower
complexity is desired), all services may be taken down and restarted at the
same time.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Before maintenance window:<ul>
<li>Start the process with the controller node. Install the code for the next
version of Nova, either in a venv or a separate control plane node,
including all the python dependencies.</li>
<li>Using the newly installed nova code, run the DB sync.
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nova-manage</span> <span class="pre">db</span> <span class="pre">sync</span></code>; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nova-manage</span> <span class="pre">api_db</span> <span class="pre">sync</span></code>). These schema
change operations should have minimal or no effect on performance, and
should not cause any operations to fail.</li>
<li>At this point, new columns and tables may exist in the database. These
DB schema changes are done in a way that both the N and N+1 release can
perform operations against the same schema.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During maintenance window:<ul>
<li>For maximum safety (no failed API operations), gracefully shutdown all
the services (i.e. SIG_TERM) except nova-compute.</li>
<li>Start all services on the new code, with
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[upgrade_levels]compute=auto</span></code> in nova.conf.  It is safest to
start nova-conductor first and nova-api last. Note that you may
use a static alias name instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auto</span></code>, such as
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[upgrade_levels]compute=newton</span></code>. Also note that this step is
only required if compute services are not upgraded in lock-step
with the control services.</li>
<li>If desired, gracefully shutdown nova-compute (i.e. SIG_TERM)
services in small batches, then start the new version of the code
with: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[upgrade_levels]compute=auto</span></code>. If this batch-based approach
is used, only a few compute nodes will have any delayed API
actions, and to ensure there is enough capacity online to service
any boot requests that happen during this time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After maintenance window:<ul>
<li>Once all services are running the new code, double check in the DB that
there are no old orphaned service records using <cite>nova service-list</cite>.</li>
<li>Now that all services are upgraded, we need to send the SIG_HUP signal, so all
the services clear any cached service version data. When a new service
starts, it automatically detects which version of the compute RPC protocol
to use, and it can decide if it is safe to do any online data migrations.
Note, if you used a static value for the upgrade_level, such as
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[upgrade_levels]compute=newton</span></code>, you must update nova.conf to remove
that configuration value and do a full service restart.</li>
<li>Now all the services are upgraded and signaled, the system is able to use
the latest version of the RPC protocol and can access all of the
features in the new release.</li>
<li>Once all the services are running the latest version of the code, and all
the services are aware they all have been upgraded, it is safe to
transform the data in the database into its new format. While some of this
work happens on demand when the system reads a database row that needs
updating, we must get all the data transformed into the current version
before the next upgrade. Additionally, some data may not be transformed
automatically so performing the data migration is necessary to avoid
performance degredation due to compatibility routines.</li>
<li>This process can put significant extra write load on the
database.  Complete all online data migrations using:
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nova-manage</span> <span class="pre">db</span> <span class="pre">online_data_migrations</span> <span class="pre">--limit</span> <span class="pre">&lt;number&gt;</span></code>. Note
that you can use the limit argument to reduce the load this
operation will place on the database, which allows you to run a
small chunk of the migrations until all of the work is done. Each
time it is run, it will show summary of completed and remaining
records. You run this command until you see completed and
remaining records as zeros. The chunk size you should use depend
on your infrastructure and how much additional load you can
impose on the database. To reduce load, perform smaller batches
with delays between chunks. To reduce time to completion, run
larger batches.</li>
<li>At this point, you must also ensure you update the configuration, to stop
using any deprecated features or options, and perform any required work
to transition to alternative features. All the deprecated options should
be supported for one cycle, but should be removed before your next
upgrade is performed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Current Database Upgrade Types<a class="headerlink" href="#current-database-upgrade-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently Nova has 2 types of database upgrades that are in use.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Schema Migrations</li>
<li>Data Migrations</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="schema-migrations">
<h3>Schema Migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#schema-migrations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Schema migrations are defined in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nova/db/sqlalchemy/migrate_repo/versions</span></code> and in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nova/db/sqlalchemy/api_migrations/migrate_repo/versions</span></code>. They are
the routines that transform our database structure, which should be
additive and able to be applied to a running system before service
code has been upgraded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-migrations">
<h3>Data Migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#data-migrations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Online data migrations occur in two places:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Inline migrations that occur as part of normal run-time
activity as data is read in the old format and written in the
new format</li>
<li>Background online migrations that are performed using
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nova-manage</span></code> to complete transformations that will not occur
incidentially due to normal runtime activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of online data migrations are the flavor migrations done as part
of Nova object version 1.18. This included a transient migration of flavor
storage from one database location to another.</p>
<p><em>Note: Database downgrades are not supported.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration-policy">
<h3>Migration policy:<a class="headerlink" href="#migration-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following guidelines for schema and data migrations are followed in order
to ease upgrades:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Additive schema migrations - In general, almost all schema migrations should
be additive.  Put simply, they should only create elements like columns,
indices, and tables.</li>
<li>Subtractive schema migrations - To remove an element like a column or table
during the N release cycle:<ol class="arabic">
<li>The element must be deprecated and retained for backward compatibility.
(This allows for graceful upgrade from N to N+1.)</li>
<li>Data migration, by the objects layer, must completely migrate data from
the old version of the schema to the new version.<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/kilo/implemented/flavor-from-sysmeta-to-blob.html">Data migration example</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/174480/15/nova/db/sqlalchemy/migrate_repo/versions/291_enforce_flavors_migrated.py">Data migration enforcement example</a>
(for sqlalchemy migrate/deprecated scripts):</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The column can then be removed with a migration at the start of N+2.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>All schema migrations should be idempotent.  (For example, a migration
should check if an element exists in the schema before attempting to add
it.)  This logic comes for free in the autogenerated workflow of
the online migrations.</li>
<li>Constraints - When adding a foreign or unique key constraint, the schema
migration code needs to handle possible problems with data before applying
the constraint. (Example:  A unique constraint must clean up duplicate
records before applying said constraint.)</li>
<li>Data migrations - As mentioned above, data migrations will be done in an
online fashion by custom code in the object layer that handles moving data
between the old and new portions of the schema.  In addition, for each type
of data migration performed, there should exist a nova-manage option for an
operator to manually request that rows be migrated.<ul>
<li>See <a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/kilo/implemented/flavor-from-sysmeta-to-blob.html">flavor migration spec</a>
for an example of data migrations in the object layer.</li>

<div class="section" id="concepts">
<h2>Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here are the key concepts you need to know before reading the section on the
upgrade process:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>RPC version pinning</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Through careful RPC versioning, newer nodes are able to talk to older
nova-compute nodes. When upgrading control plane nodes, we can pin them
at an older version of the compute RPC API, until all the compute nodes
are able to be upgraded.
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/RpcMajorVersionUpdates">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/RpcMajorVersionUpdates</a></p>
<div class="last admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This does not apply to cells deployments since cells does not currently
support rolling upgrades. It is assumed that cells deployments are
upgraded in lockstep so n-1 cells compatibility does not work.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Online Configuration Reload</dt>
<dd>During the upgrade, we pin new serves at the older RPC version. When all
services are updated to use newer code, we need to unpin them so we are
able to use any new functionality.
To avoid having to restart the service, using the current SIGHUP signal
handling, or otherwise, ideally we need a way to update the currently
running process to use the latest configuration.</dd>
<dt>Graceful service shutdown</dt>
<dd>Many nova services are python processes listening for messages on a
AMQP queue, including nova-compute. When sending the process the SIGTERM
the process stops getting new work from its queue, completes any
outstanding work, then terminates. During this process, messages can be
left on the queue for when the python process starts back up.
This gives us a way to shutdown a service using older code, and start
up a service using newer code with minimal impact. If its a service that
can have multiple workers, like nova-conductor, you can usually add the
new workers before the graceful shutdown of the old workers. In the case
of singleton services, like nova-compute, some actions could be delayed
during the restart, but ideally no actions should fail due to the restart.
NOTE: while this is true for the RabbitMQ RPC backend, we need to confirm
what happens for other RPC backends.</dd>
<dt>API load balancer draining</dt>
<dd>When upgrading API nodes, you can make your load balancer only send new
connections to the newer API nodes, allowing for a seamless update of your
API nodes.</dd>
<dt>Expand/Contract DB Migrations</dt>
<dd>Modern databases are able to make many schema changes while you are still
writing to the database. Taking this a step further, we can make all DB
changes by first adding the new structures, expanding. Then you can slowly
move all the data into a new location and format. Once that is complete,
you can drop bits of the scheme that are no long needed,
i.e. contract. This happens multiple cycles after we have stopped
using a particular piece of schema, and can happen in a schema
migration without affecting runtime code.</dd>
<dt>Online Data Migrations using objects</dt>
<dd>In Kilo we are moving all data migration into the DB objects code.
When trying to migrate data in the database from the old format to the
new format, this is done in the object code when reading or saving things
that are in the old format. For records that are not updated, you need to
run a background process to convert those records into the newer format.
This process must be completed before you contract the database schema.</dd>
<dt>DB prune deleted rows</dt>
<dd>Currently resources are soft deleted in the main database, so users are able
to track instances in the DB that are created and destroyed in production.
However, most people have a data retention policy, of say 30 days or 90
days after which they will want to delete those entries. Not deleting
those entries affects DB performance as indices grow very large and data
migrations take longer as there is more data to migrate.</dd>
<dt>nova-conductor object backports</dt>
<dd>RPC pinning ensures new services can talk to the older service&#8217;s method
signatures. But many of the parameters are objects that may well be too
new for the old service to understand, so you are able to send the object
back to the nova-conductor to be downgraded to a version the older service
can understand.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h2>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once we have all the pieces in place, we hope to move the Grenade testing
to follow this new pattern.</p>
<p>The current tests only cover the existing upgrade process where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>old computes can run with new control plane</li>
<li>but control plane is turned off for DB migrations</li>
</ul>
