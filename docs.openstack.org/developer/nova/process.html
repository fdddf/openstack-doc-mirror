<p>Nova is always evolving its processes, but it&#8217;s important to explain why we
have them: so we can all work to ensure that the interactions we need to
happen do happen. The process exists to make productive communication between
all members of our community easier.</p>

<h2>OpenStack Wide Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#openstack-wide-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="feature-freeze">
<h3>Feature Freeze<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-freeze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Feature freeze primarily provides a window of time to help the horizontal
teams prepare their items for release, while giving developers time to
focus on stabilising what is currently in master, and encouraging users
and packagers to perform tests (automated, and manual) on the release, to
spot any major bugs.</p>
<p>The Nova release process is aligned with the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/release-management.html#typical-development-cycle-schedule">development cycle schedule</a>
used by many OpenStack projects, including the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Feature Proposal Freeze</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>make sure all code is up for review</li>
<li>so we can optimise for completed features, not lots of half
completed features</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Feature Freeze</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>make sure all feature code is merged</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">String Freeze</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>give translators time to translate all our strings</li>
<li>Note: debug logs are no longer translated</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Dependency Freeze</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>time to co-ordinate the final list of dependencies, and give packagers
time to package them</li>
<li>generally it is also quite destabilising to take upgrades (beyond
bug fixes) this late</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all processes here, there are exceptions. The exceptions at
this stage need to be discussed with the horizontal teams that might be
affected by changes beyond this point, and as such are discussed with
one of the OpenStack release managers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spec-and-blueprint-approval-freeze">
<h3>Spec and Blueprint Approval Freeze<a class="headerlink" href="#spec-and-blueprint-approval-freeze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is a (mostly) Nova specific process.</p>
<p>Why we have a Spec Freeze:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>specs take a long time to review and reviewing specs throughout the cycle
distracts from code reviews</li>
<li>keeping specs &#8220;open&#8221; and being slow at reviewing them (or just
ignoring them) annoys the spec submitters</li>
<li>we generally have more code submitted that we can review, this time
bounding is a useful way to limit the number of submissions</li>
</ul>
<p>By the freeze date, we expect all blueprints that will be approved for the
cycle to be listed on launchpad and all relevant specs to be merged. For Ocata
blueprints can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/ocata">https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/ocata</a> and
specs at
<a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/ocata/index.html">http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/ocata/index.html</a></p>
<p>Starting with Liberty, we are keeping a backlog open for submission at all
times. Note: the focus is on accepting and agreeing problem statements
as being in scope, rather than queueing up work items for the next
release. We are still working on a new lightweight process to get out of
the backlog and approved for a particular release. For more details on
backlog specs, please see:
<a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/backlog/index.html">http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/backlog/index.html</a></p>
<p>There can be exceptions, usually it&#8217;s an urgent feature request that
comes up after the initial deadline. These will generally be discussed
at the weekly Nova meeting, by adding the spec or blueprint to discuss
in the appropriate place in the meeting agenda here (ideally make
yourself available to discuss the blueprint, or alternatively make your
case on the ML before the meeting):
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/Nova#Agenda_for_next_meeting">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/Nova#Agenda_for_next_meeting</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="non-priority-feature-freeze">
<h3>Non-priority Feature Freeze<a class="headerlink" href="#non-priority-feature-freeze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is a Nova specific process.</p>
<p>This only applies to low priority blueprints in this list:
<a class="reference external" href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/ocata">https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/ocata</a></p>
<p>We currently have a very finite amount of review bandwidth. In order to
make code review time for the agreed community wide priorities, we have
to not do some other things. In each cycle, milestones are used to bound
when certain types of work will be active and reviewed and to avoid crushing
the gate with too much code near the end of the cycle.</p>
<p>For example, in the Liberty cycle, we reserved the liberty-3 milestone for
priority features and bug fixes and did not merge any non-priority things
during liberty-3. This meant that liberty-2 was the &#8220;Feature Freeze&#8221; for
blueprints that were not a priority for the Liberty cycle.</p>
<p>You can see the list of priorities for each release:
<a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/#priorities">http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/#priorities</a></p>
<p>For things that are very close to merging, it&#8217;s possible to request an
exception for one week after the freeze date, given the patches get
enough +2s from the core team to get the code merged. But we expect this
list to be zero, if everything goes to plan (no massive gate failures,
etc). For history of the process see:
<a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-July/070920.html">http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-July/070920.html</a></p>
<p>Exception process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Please add request in here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-nova-non-priority-feature-freeze">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-nova-non-priority-feature-freeze</a>
(ideally with core reviewers to sponsor your patch, normally the
folks who have already viewed those patches)</li>
<li>make sure you make your request before the end of the feature freeze
exception period</li>
<li>nova-drivers will meet to decide what gets an exception (for some history
see:
<a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-February/056208.html">http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-February/056208.html</a>)</li>
<li>an initial list of exceptions (probably just a PTL compiled list at
that point) will be available for discussion during the next Nova meeting</li>
<li>the aim is to merge the code for all exceptions early in the following week</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It was hoped to make this a continuous process using &#8220;slots&#8221; to
control what gets reviewed, but this was rejected by the community
when it was last discussed. There is hope this can be resurrected to
avoid the &#8220;lumpy&#8221; nature of this process.</li>
<li>Currently the runways/kanban ideas are blocked on us adopting
something like phabricator that could support such workflows</li>

<div class="section" id="string-freeze">
<h3>String Freeze<a class="headerlink" href="#string-freeze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>String Freeze provides an opportunity for translators to translate user-visible
messages to a variety of languages. By not changing strings after the date of
the string freeze, the job of the translators is made a bit easier. For more

<p>To understand this question, we need to understand why blueprints and
specs are useful.</p>
<p>But here is the rough idea:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if it needs a spec, it will need a blueprint.</li>
<li>if it&#8217;s an API change, it needs a spec.</li>
<li>if it&#8217;s a single small patch that touches a small amount of code,
with limited deployer and doc impact, it probably doesn&#8217;t need a
spec.</li>

nova-drivers.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-do-i-get-a-procedural-2-removed-from-my-patch">
<h3>How do I get a procedural -2 removed from my patch?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-get-a-procedural-2-removed-from-my-patch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When feature freeze hits, any patches for blueprints that are still in review
get a procedural -2 to stop them merging. In Nova a blueprint is only approved
for a single release. To have the -2 removed, you need to get the blueprint
approved for the current release (see <a class="reference internal" href="#how-do-i-get-my-blueprint-approved">How do I get my blueprint approved?</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-are-the-reviewers-being-mean-to-me">
<h3>Why are the reviewers being mean to me?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-the-reviewers-being-mean-to-me" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Code reviews take intense concentration and a lot of time. This tends to
lead to terse responses with very little preamble or nicety. That said,
there&#8217;s no excuse for being actively rude or mean. OpenStack has a Code
of Conduct (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/">https://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/</a>)
and if you feel this has been breached please raise the matter
privately. Either with the relevant parties, the PTL or failing those,
the OpenStack Foundation.</p>
<p>That said, there are many objective reasons for applying a -1 or -2 to a
patch:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firstly and simply, patches must address their intended purpose
successfully.</li>
<li>Patches must not have negative side-effects like wiping the database
or causing a functional regression. Usually removing anything,
however tiny, requires a deprecation warning be issued for a cycle.</li>
<li>Code must be maintainable, that is it must adhere to coding standards
and be as readable as possible for an average OpenStack developer
(we acknowledge that this person is not easy to define).</li>
<li>Patches must respect the direction of the project, for example they
should not make approved specs substantially more difficult to
implement.</li>
<li>Release coordinators need the correct process to be followed so scope
can be tracked accurately. Bug fixes require bugs, features require
blueprints and all but the simplest features require specs. If there
is a blueprint, it must be approved for the release/milestone the
patch is attempting to merge into.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please particularly bear in mind that a -2 does not mean &#8220;never ever&#8221;
nor does it mean &#8220;your idea is bad and you are dumb&#8221;. It simply means
&#8220;do not merge today&#8221;. You may need to wait some time, rethink your
approach or even revisit the problem definition but there is almost
always some way forward. The core who applied the -2 should tell you
what you need to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-code-review-seems-stuck-what-can-i-do">
<h3>My code review seems stuck, what can I do?<a class="headerlink" href="#my-code-review-seems-stuck-what-can-i-do" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First and foremost - address any -1s and -2s! The review load on Nova is
high enough that patches with negative reviews often get filtered out
entirely. A few tips:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be precise. Ensure you&#8217;re not talking at cross purposes.</li>
<li>Try to understand where the reviewer is coming from. They may have a
very different perspective and/or use-case to you.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t understand the problem, ask them to explain - this is
common and helpful behaviour.</li>
<li>Be positive. Everyone&#8217;s patches have issues, including core
reviewers. No-one cares once the issues are fixed.</li>
<li>Try not to flip-flop. When two reviewers are pulling you in different
directions, stop pushing code and negotiate the best way forward.</li>
<li>If the reviewer does not respond to replies left on the patchset,
reach out to them on IRC or email. If they still don&#8217;t respond, you
can try to ask their colleagues if they&#8217;re on holiday (or simply
wait). Finally, you can ask for mediation in the Nova meeting by
adding it to the agenda
(<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/Nova">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/Nova</a>). This is also what
you should do if you are unable to negotiate a resolution to an
issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, Nova is a big project, be aware of the average wait times:
<a class="reference external" href="http://russellbryant.net/openstack-stats/nova-openreviews.html">http://russellbryant.net/openstack-stats/nova-openreviews.html</a></p>
<p>Eventually you should get some +1s from people working through the
review queue. Expect to get -1s as well. You can ask for reviews within
your company, 1-2 are useful (not more), especially if those reviewers
are known to give good reviews. You can spend some time while you wait
reviewing other people&#8217;s code - they may reciprocate and you may learn
something (<a class="reference internal" href="how_to_get_involved.html#why-plus1"><span>Why do code reviews when I&#8217;m not core?</span></a>).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve waited an appropriate amount of time and you haven&#8217;t had any
+1s, you can ask on IRC for reviews. Please don&#8217;t ask for core review
straight away, especially not directly (IRC or email). Core reviewer
time is very valuable and gaining some +1s is a good way to show your
patch meets basic quality standards.</p>
<p>Once you have a few +1s, be patient. Remember the average wait times.
You can ask for reviews each week in IRC, it helps to ask when cores are
awake.</p>
<div class="section" id="bugs">
<h4>Bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It helps to apply correct tracking information.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Put &#8220;Closes-Bug&#8221;, &#8220;Partial-Bug&#8221; or &#8220;Related-Bug&#8221; in the commit
message tags as necessary.</li>
<li>If you have to raise a bug in Launchpad first, do it - this helps
someone else find your fix.</li>
<li>Make sure the bug has the correct priority and tag set:
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/BugTriage#Step_2:_Triage_Tagged_Bugs">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/BugTriage#Step_2:_Triage_Tagged_Bugs</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h4>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Again, it helps to apply correct tracking information. For
blueprint-only features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Put your blueprint in the commit message, EG &#8220;blueprint
simple-feature&#8221;.</li>
<li>Mark the blueprint as NeedsCodeReview if you are finished.</li>
<li>Maintain the whiteboard on the blueprint so it&#8217;s easy to understand
which patches need reviews.</li>
<li>Use a single topic for all related patches. All patches for one
blueprint should share a topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>For blueprint and spec features, do everything for blueprint-only
features and also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If it&#8217;s a project or subteam priority, add it to:
<a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-nova-priorities-tracking">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-nova-priorities-tracking</a></li>
<li>Ensure your spec is approved for the current release cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your code is a project or subteam priority, the cores interested in
that priority might not mind a ping after it has sat with +1s for a
week. If you abuse this privilege, you&#8217;ll lose respect.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not a priority, your blueprint/spec has been approved for the
cycle and you have been patient, you can raise it during the Nova
meeting. The outcome may be that your spec gets unapproved for the
cycle, so that priority items can take focus. If this happens to you,
sorry - it should not have been approved in the first place, Nova team
bit off more than they could chew, it is their mistake not yours. You
can re-propose it for the next cycle.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not a priority and your spec has not been approved, your code
will not merge this cycle. Please re-propose your spec for the next
cycle.</p>

feature is not adopted by the ecosystem, it will make it hard for your
users to make use of those features, defeating most of the reason to add
the feature in the first place. The microversion system allows users to
isolate themselves</p>
<p>This is a very different aim to being &#8220;pluggable&#8221; or wanting to expose
all capabilities to end users. At the same time, it is not just a
&#8220;lowest common denominator&#8221; set of APIs. It should be discoverable which
features are available, and while no implementation details should leak
to the end users, purely admin concepts may need to understand
technology specific details that back the interoperable and more
abstract concepts that are exposed to the end user. This is a hard goal,
and one area we currently don&#8217;t do well is isolating image creators from
these technology specific details.</p>

<h3>Smooth Upgrades<a class="headerlink" href="#smooth-upgrades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As part of our mission for a vibrant ecosystem around our APIs, we want
to make it easy for those deploying Nova to upgrade with minimal impact
to their users. Here is the scope of Nova&#8217;s upgrade support:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>upgrade from any commit, to any future commit, within the same major
release</li>
<li>only support upgrades between N and N+1 major versions, to reduce
technical debt relating to upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the things we require developers to do, to help with
upgrades:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>when replacing an existing feature or configuration option, make it
clear how to transition to any replacement</li>
<li>deprecate configuration options and features before removing them<ul>
<li>i.e. continue to support and test features for at least one
release before they are removed</li>
<li>this gives time for operator feedback on any removals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>End User API will always be kept backwards compatible</li>

<h3>Interaction goals<a class="headerlink" href="#interaction-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When thinking about the importance of process, we should take a look at:
<a class="reference external" href="http://agilemanifesto.org">http://agilemanifesto.org</a></p>
<p>With that in mind, let&#8217;s look at how we want different members of the
community to interact. Let&#8217;s start with looking at issues we have tried
to resolve in the past (currently in no particular order). We must:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>have a way for everyone to review blueprints and designs, including
allowing for input from operators and all types of users (keep it
open)</li>
<li>take care to not expand Nova&#8217;s scope any more than absolutely
necessary</li>
<li>ensure we get sufficient focus on the core of Nova so that we can
maintain or improve the stability and flexibility of the overall
codebase</li>
<li>support any API we release approximately forever. We currently
release every commit, so we&#8217;re motivated to get the API right the first
time</li>
<li>avoid low priority blueprints that slow work on high priority work,
without blocking those forever</li>
<li>focus on a consistent experience for our users, rather than ease of
development</li>
<li>optimise for completed blueprints, rather than more half completed
blueprints, so we get maximum value for our users out of our review
bandwidth</li>
<li>focus efforts on a subset of patches to allow our core reviewers to
be more productive</li>
<li>set realistic expectations on what can be reviewed in a particular
cycle, to avoid sitting in an expensive rebase loop</li>
<li>be aware of users that do not work on the project full time</li>
<li>be aware of users that are only able to work on the project at
certain times that may not align with the overall community cadence</li>
<li>discuss designs for non-trivial work before implementing it, to avoid
the expense of late-breaking design issues</li>

<div class="section" id="why-are-specs-useful">
<h3>Why are specs useful?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-specs-useful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Spec reviews allow anyone to step up and contribute to reviews, just
like with code. Before we used gerrit, it was a very messy review
process, that felt very &#8220;closed&#8221; to most people involved in that
process.</p>
<p>As Nova has grown in size, it can be hard to work out how to modify Nova
to meet your needs. Specs are a great way of having that discussion with
the wider Nova community.</p>
<p>For Nova to be a success, we need to ensure we don&#8217;t break our existing
users. The spec template helps focus the mind on the impact your change
might have on existing users and gives an opportunity to discuss the
best way to deal with those issues.</p>
<p>However, there are some pitfalls with the process. Here are some top
tips to avoid them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>keep it simple. Shorter, simpler, more decomposed specs are quicker
to review and merge much quicker (just like code patches).</li>
<li>specs can help with documentation but they are only intended to
document the design discussion rather than document the final code.</li>
<li>don&#8217;t add details that are best reviewed in code, it&#8217;s better to
leave those things for the code review.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-we-have-specs-why-still-have-blueprints">
<h3>If we have specs, why still have blueprints?<a class="headerlink" href="#if-we-have-specs-why-still-have-blueprints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We use specs to record the design agreement, we use blueprints to track
progress on the implementation of the spec.</p>
<p>Currently, in Nova, specs are only approved for one release, and must be
re-submitted for each release you want to merge the spec, although that
is currently under review.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-do-we-have-priorities">
<h3>Why do we have priorities?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-have-priorities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To be clear, there is no &#8220;nova dev team manager&#8221;, we are an open team of
professional software developers, that all work for a variety of (mostly
competing) companies that collaborate to ensure the Nova project is a
success.</p>
<p>Over time, a lot of technical debt has accumulated, because there was a
lack of collective ownership to solve those cross-cutting concerns.
Before the Kilo release, it was noted that progress felt much slower,
because we were unable to get appropriate attention on the architectural
evolution of Nova. This was important, partly for major concerns like
upgrades and stability. We agreed it&#8217;s something we all care about and
it needs to be given priority to ensure that these things get fixed.</p>
<p>Since Kilo, priorities have been discussed at the summit. This turns in
to a spec review which eventually means we get a list of priorities
here: <a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/#priorities">http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/#priorities</a></p>
<p>Allocating our finite review bandwidth to these efforts means we have to
limit the reviews we do on non-priority items. This is mostly why we now
have the non-priority Feature Freeze. For more on this, see below.</p>
<p>Blocking a priority effort is one of the few widely acceptable reasons
to block someone adding a feature. One of the great advantages of being
more explicit about that relationship is that people can step up to help
review and/or implement the work that is needed to unblock the feature
they want to get landed. This is a key part of being an Open community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-there-a-feature-freeze-and-string-freeze-in-nova">
<h3>Why is there a Feature Freeze (and String Freeze) in Nova?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-there-a-feature-freeze-and-string-freeze-in-nova" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main reason Nova has a feature freeze is that it allows people
working on docs and translations to sync up with the latest code.
Traditionally this happens at the same time across multiple projects, so
the docs are synced between what used to be called the &#8220;integrated
release&#8221;.</p>
<p>We also use this time period as an excuse to focus our development
efforts on bug fixes, ideally lower risk bug fixes, and improving test
coverage.</p>
<p>In theory, with a waterfall hat on, this would be a time for testing and
stabilisation of the product. In Nova we have a much stronger focus on
keeping every commit stable, by making use of extensive continuous
testing. In reality, we frequently see the biggest influx of fixes in
the few weeks after the release, as distributions do final testing of
the released code.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the work on Feature Classification will lead us to
better understand the levels of testing of different Nova features, so
we will be able to reduce and dependency between Feature Freeze and
regression testing. It is also likely that the move away from
&#8220;integrated&#8221; releases will help find a more developer friendly approach
to keep the docs and translations in sync.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-there-a-non-priority-feature-freeze-in-nova">
<h3>Why is there a non-priority Feature Freeze in Nova?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-there-a-non-priority-feature-freeze-in-nova" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have already discussed why we have priority features.</p>
<p>The rate at which code can be merged to Nova is primarily constrained by
the amount of time able to be spent reviewing code. Given this,
earmarking review time for priority items means depriving it from
non-priority items.</p>
<p>The simplest way to make space for the priority features is to stop
reviewing and merging non-priority features for a whole milestone. The
idea being developers should focus on bug fixes and priority features
during that milestone, rather than working on non-priority features.</p>
<p>A known limitation of this approach is developer frustration. Many
developers are not being given permission to review code, work on bug
fixes or work on priority features, and so feel very unproductive
upstream. An alternative approach of &#8220;slots&#8221; or &#8220;runways&#8221; has been
considered, that uses a kanban style approach to regulate the influx of
work onto the review queue. We are yet to get agreement on a more
balanced approach, so the existing system is being continued to ensure
priority items are more likely to get the attention they require.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-can-i-get-my-code-merged-faster">
<h3>How can I get my code merged faster?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-get-my-code-merged-faster" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So no-one is coming to review your code, how do you speed up that
process?</p>
<p>Firstly, make sure you are following the above process. If it&#8217;s a
feature, make sure you have an approved blueprint. If it&#8217;s a bug, make
sure it is triaged, has its priority set correctly, it has the correct
bug tag and is marked as in progress. If the blueprint has all the code
up for review, change it from Started into NeedsCodeReview so people
know only reviews are blocking you, make sure it hasn&#8217;t accidentally got
marked as implemented.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you have a negative review (-1 or -2) and you responded to
that in a comment or uploading a new change with some updates, but that
reviewer hasn&#8217;t come back for over a week, it&#8217;s probably a good time to
reach out to the reviewer on IRC (or via email) to see if they could
look again now you have addressed their comments. If you can&#8217;t get
agreement, and your review gets stuck (i.e. requires mediation), you can
raise your patch during the Nova meeting and we will try to resolve any
disagreement.</p>
<p>Thirdly, is it in merge conflict with master or are any of the CI tests
failing? Particularly any third-party CI tests that are relevant to the
code you are changing. If you&#8217;re fixing something that only occasionally
failed before, maybe recheck a few times to prove the tests stay
passing. Without green tests, reviewers tend to move on and look at the
other patches that have the tests passing.</p>
<p>OK, so you have followed all the process (i.e. your patches are getting
advertised via the project&#8217;s tracking mechanisms), and your patches
either have no reviews, or only positive reviews. Now what?</p>
<p>Have you considered reviewing other people&#8217;s patches? Firstly,
participating in the review process is the best way for you to
understand what reviewers are wanting to see in the code you are
submitting. As you get more practiced at reviewing it will help you to
write &#8220;merge-ready&#8221; code. Secondly, if you help review other peoples
code and help get their patches ready for the core reviewers to add a
+2, it will free up a lot of non-core and core reviewer time, so they
are more likely to get time to review your code. For more details,
please see: <a class="reference internal" href="how_to_get_involved.html#why-plus1"><span>Why do code reviews when I&#8217;m not core?</span></a></p>
<p>Please note, I am not recommending you go to ask people on IRC or via
email for reviews. Please try to get your code reviewed using the above
process first. In many cases multiple direct pings generate frustration
on both sides and that tends to be counter productive.</p>
<p>Now you have got your code merged, lets make sure you don&#8217;t need to fix
this bug again. The fact the bug exists means there is a gap in our
testing. Your patch should have included some good unit tests to stop
the bug coming back. But don&#8217;t stop there, maybe its time to add tempest
tests, to make sure your use case keeps working? Maybe you need to set
up a third party CI so your combination of drivers will keep working?
Getting that extra testing in place should stop a whole heap of bugs,
again giving reviewers more time to get to the issues or features you
want to add in the future.</p>

<h3>Splitting out the virt drivers (or other bits of code)<a class="headerlink" href="#splitting-out-the-virt-drivers-or-other-bits-of-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently, Nova doesn&#8217;t have strong enough interfaces to split out the
virt drivers, scheduler or REST API. This is seen as the key blocker.
Let&#8217;s look at both sides of the debate here.</p>
<p>Reasons for the split:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>can have separate core teams for each repo<ul>
<li>this leads to quicker turn around times, largely due to focused
teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>splitting out things from core means less knowledge required to
become core in a specific area</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons against the split:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>loss of interoperability between drivers<ul>
<li>this is a core part of Nova&#8217;s mission, to have a single API across
all deployments, and a strong ecosystem of tools and apps built on
that</li>
<li>we can overcome some of this with stronger interfaces and
functional tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>new features often need changes in the API and virt driver anyway<ul>
<li>the new &#8220;depends-on&#8221; can make these cross-repo dependencies easier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>loss of code style consistency across the code base</li>
<li>fear of fragmenting the nova community, leaving few to work on the
core of the project</li>
<li>could work in subteams within the main tree</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO - need to complete analysis</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subteam-recommendation-as-a-2">
<h3>Subteam recommendation as a +2<a class="headerlink" href="#subteam-recommendation-as-a-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are groups of people with great knowledge of particular bits of
the code base. It may be a good idea to give their recommendation of a
merge greater strength. In addition, having the subteam focus review efforts
on a subset of patches should help concentrate the nova-core reviews they
get, and increase the velocity of getting code merged.</p>
<p>The first part is for subgroups to show they can do a great job of
recommending patches. This is starting in here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-nova-priorities-tracking">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-nova-priorities-tracking</a></p>
<p>Ideally this would be done with gerrit user &#8220;tags&#8221; rather than an
etherpad. There are some investigations by sdague in how feasible it
would be to add tags to gerrit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stop-having-to-submit-a-spec-for-each-release">
<h3>Stop having to submit a spec for each release<a class="headerlink" href="#stop-having-to-submit-a-spec-for-each-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we use blueprints for tracking, and specs to record
design decisions. Targeting specs to a specific release is a heavyweight
solution and blurs the lines between specs and blueprints. At the same
time, we don&#8217;t want to lose the opportunity to revise existing
blueprints. Maybe there is a better balance?</p>
<p>What about this kind of process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>backlog has these folders:<ul>
<li>backlog/incomplete - merge a partial spec</li>
<li>backlog/complete - merge complete specs (remove tracking details,
such as assignee part of the template)</li>
<li>?? backlog/expired - specs are moved here from incomplete or
complete when no longer seem to be given attention (after 1 year,
by default)</li>
<li>/implemented - when a spec is complete it gets moved into the
release directory and possibly updated to reflect what actually
happened</li>
<li>there will no longer be a per-release approved spec list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To get your blueprint approved:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>add it to the next nova meeting<ul>
<li>if a spec is required, update the URL to point to the spec merged
in a spec to the blueprint</li>
<li>ensure there is an assignee in the blueprint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a day before the meeting, a note is sent to the ML to review the list
before the meeting</li>
<li>discuss any final objections in the nova-meeting<ul>
<li>this may result in a request to refine the spec, if things have
changed since it was merged</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>trivial cases can be approved in advance by a nova-driver, so not all
folks need to go through the meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>This still needs more thought, but should decouple the spec review from
the release process. It is also more compatible with a runway style
system, that might be less focused on milestones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runways">
<h3>Runways<a class="headerlink" href="#runways" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Runways are a form of Kanban, where we look at optimising the flow
through the system, by ensuring we focus our efforts on reviewing a
specific subset of patches.</p>
<p>The idea goes something like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>define some states, such as: design backlog, design review, code
backlog, code review, test+doc backlog, complete</li>
<li>blueprints must be in one of the above state<ul>
<li>large or high priority bugs may also occupy a code review slot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>core reviewer member moves item between the slots<ul>
<li>must not violate the rules on the number of items in each state</li>
<li>states have a limited number of slots, to ensure focus</li>
<li>certain percentage of slots are dedicated to priorities, depending
on point in the cycle, and the type of the cycle, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>more focused review effort, get more things merged more quickly</li>
<li>more upfront about when your code is likely to get reviewed</li>
<li>smooth out current &#8220;lumpy&#8221; non-priority feature freeze system</li>

release would help signal to our users that people can use the
milestones in production, and get a level of upgrade support.</p>
<p>It could go something like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>14.0.0 is milestone 1</li>
<li>14.0.1 is milestone 2 (maybe, because we add features, it should be
14.1.0?)</li>
<li>14.0.2 is milestone 3</li>
<li>we might do other releases (once a critical bug is fixed?), as it
makes sense, but we will always be the time bound ones</li>
<li>14.0.3 two weeks after milestone 3, adds only bug fixes (and updates
to RPC versions?)<ul>
<li>maybe a stable branch is created at this point?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>14.1.0 adds updated translations and co-ordinated docs<ul>
<li>this is released from the stable branch?</li>
</ul>

<li>15.0.0 is the next milestone, in the following cycle<ul>
