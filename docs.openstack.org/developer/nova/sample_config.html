<span class="c1"># DEPRECATED:</span>
<span class="c1"># This option is used to decide when an image should have no external</span>
<span class="c1"># ramdisk or kernel. By default this is set to &#39;nokernel&#39;, so when an</span>
<span class="c1"># image is booted with the property &#39;kernel_id&#39; with the value</span>

<span class="c1"># This option is deprecated for removal since 15.0.0.</span>
<span class="c1"># Its value may be silently ignored in the future.</span>

<span class="c1"># When an image is booted with the property &#39;kernel_id&#39; with the value</span>
<span class="c1"># &#39;nokernel&#39;, Nova assumes the image doesn&#39;t require an external kernel and</span>
<span class="c1"># ramdisk. This option allows user to change the API behaviour which should not</span>
<span class="c1"># be allowed and this value &quot;nokernel&quot; should be hard coded.</span>
<span class="c1">#null_kernel = nokernel</span>

<span class="c1"># DEPRECATED:</span>
<span class="c1"># When creating multiple instances with a single request using the</span>
<span class="c1"># os-multiple-create API extension, this template will be used to build</span>

<span class="c1"># This option is deprecated for removal since 15.0.0.</span>

<span class="c1"># A negative number means unlimited. Setting max_local_block_devices</span>
<span class="c1"># to 0 means that any request that attempts to create a local disk</span>
<span class="c1"># will fail. This option is meant to limit the number of local discs</span>
<span class="c1"># (so root local disc that is the result of --image being used, and</span>
<span class="c1"># any other ephemeral and swap disks). 0 does not mean that images</span>

<span class="c1"># volumes - it just means that all requests that attempt to create a</span>
<span class="c1"># local disk will fail.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Possible values:</span>
