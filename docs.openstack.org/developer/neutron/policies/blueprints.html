<h1>Blueprints and Specs<a class="headerlink" href="#blueprints-and-specs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Neutron team uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-specs">neutron-specs</a> repository for its
specification reviews. Detailed information can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints">wiki</a>. Please also find
additional information in the reviews.rst file.</p>
<p>The Neutron team does not enforce deadlines for specs. These can be submitted
throughout the release cycle. The drivers team will review this on a regular
basis throughout the release, and based on the load for the milestones, will
assign these into milestones or move them to the backlog for selection into
a future release.</p>
<p>Please note that we use a <a class="reference external" href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-specs/tree/specs/template.rst">template</a>
for spec submissions. It is not required to fill out all sections in the
template. Review of the spec may require filling in information left out by
the submitter.</p>
<div class="section" id="sub-projects-and-specs">
<h2>Sub-Projects and Specs<a class="headerlink" href="#sub-projects-and-specs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-specs">neutron-specs</a>
repository is only meant for specs from Neutron itself, and the advanced
services repositories as well. This includes FWaaS, LBaaS, and VPNaaS. Other
sub-projects are encouraged to fold their specs into their own devref code
in their sub-project gerrit repositories. Please see additional commments
in the Neutron teams <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/policies/neutron-teams.html#neutron-specs-core-reviewer-team">section</a>
for reviewer requirements of the neutron-specs repository.</p>

<div class="section" id="neutron-request-for-feature-enhancements">
<h2>Neutron Request for Feature Enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#neutron-request-for-feature-enhancements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Liberty the team introduced the concept of feature requests. Feature
requests are tracked as Launchpad bugs, tagged with the new &#8216;rfe&#8217; tag, and
allow for the submission and review of these feature requests before code
is submitted.
This allows the team to verify the validity of a feature request before the
process of submitting a neutron-spec is undertaken, or code is written.  It
also allows the community to express interest in a feature by subscribing to
the bug and posting a comment in Launchpad. The &#8216;rfe&#8217; tag should not be used
for work that is already well-defined and has an assignee. If you are intending
to submit code immediately, a simple bug report will suffice. Note the
temptation to game the system exists, but given the history in Neutron for this
type of activity, it will not be tolerated and will be called out as such in
public on the mailing list.</p>
<p>RFEs can be submitted by anyone and by having the community vote on them in
Launchpad, we can gauge interest in features. The drivers team will evaluate
these on a weekly basis along with the specs. RFEs will be evaluated in the
current cycle against existing project priorities and available resources.</p>
<p>The workflow for the life an RFE in Launchpad is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The bug is submitted and will by default land in the &#8220;New&#8221; state.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As soon as a member of the neutron-drivers team acknowledges the bug, it will
be moved into the &#8220;Confirmed&#8221; state. No assignee, or milestone is set at this
time. The importance will be set to &#8216;Wishlist&#8217; to signal the fact that the
report is indeed a feature or enhancement and there is no severity associated
to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The bug goes into the &#8220;Triaged&#8221; state while the discussion is ongoing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The neutron-drivers team will evaluate the RFE and may advise the submitter
to file a spec in neutron-specs to elaborate on the feature request, in case
the RFE requires extra scrutiny, more design discussion, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The PTL will work with the Lieutenant for the area being identified by the
RFE to evaluate resources against the current workload.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A member of the Neutron release team (or the PTL) will register a matching
Launchpad blueprint to be used for milestone tracking purposes, and for
identifying the responsible assignee and approver. If the RFE has a spec
the blueprint will have a pointer to the spec document, which will become
available on <a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/">specs.o.o.</a>
once it is approved and merged. The blueprint will then be linked to the
original RFE bug report as a pointer to the discussion that led to the
appoval of the RFE.
The blueprint submitter will also need to identify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Priority: there will be only two priorities to choose from, High and Low.
It is worth noting that priority is not to be confused with
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Bugs#Importance">importance</a>,
which is a property of Launchpad Bugs. Priority gives an indication of
how promptly a work item should be tackled to allow it to complete. High
priority is to be chosen for work items that must make substantial
progress in the span of the targeted release, and deal with the
following aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OpenStack cross-project interaction and interoperability issues;</li>
<li>Issues that affect the existing system&#8217;s usability;</li>
<li>Stability and testability of the platform;</li>
<li>Risky implementations that may require complex and/or pervasive
changes to API and the logical model;</li>
</ul>
<p>Low priority is to be chosen for everything else. RFEs without an associated
blueprint are effectively equivalent to low priority items. Bear in mind that,
even though staffing should take priorities into account (i.e. by giving more
resources to high priority items over low priority ones), the open source
reality is that they can both proceed at their own pace and low priority items
can indeed complete faster than high priority ones, even though they are
given fewer resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Drafter: who is going to submit and iterate on the spec proposal; he/she
may be the RFE submitter.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Assignee: who is going to develop the bulk of the code, or the
go-to contributor, if more people are involved. Typically this is
the RFE submitter, but not necessarily.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Approver: a member of the Neutron team who can commit enough time
during the ongoing release cycle to ensure that code posted for review
does not languish, and that all aspects of the feature development are
taken care of (client, server changes and/or support from other projects
if needed - tempest, nova, openstack-infra, devstack, etc.), as well as
comprehensive testing.
This is typically a core member who has enough experience with what it
takes to get code merged, but other resources amongst the wider team can
also be identified. Approvers are volunteers who show a specific interest
in the blueprint specification, and have enough insight in the area of
work so that they can make effective code reviews and provide design
feedback. An approver will not work in isolation, as he/she can and will
reach out for help to get the job done; however he/she is the main
point of contact with the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pair up with the drafter/assignee in order to help skip development
blockers.</li>
<li>Review patches associated with the blueprint: approver and assignee
should touch base regularly and ping each other when new code is
available for review, or if review feedback goes unaddressed.</li>
<li>Reach out to other reviewers for feedback in areas that may step
out of the zone of her/his confidence.</li>
<li>Escalate issues, and raise warnings to the release team/PTL if the
effort shows slow progress. Approver and assignee are key parts to land
a blueprint: should the approver and/or assignee be unable to continue
the commitment during the release cycle, it is the Approver&#8217;s
responsibility to reach out the release team/PTL so that replacements
can be identified.</li>
<li>Provide a status update during the Neutron IRC meeting, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approver <a class="reference external" href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+assignments">assignments</a>
must be carefully identified to ensure that no-one overcommits. A
Neutron contributor develops code himself/herself, and if he/she is an
approver of more than a couple of blueprints in a single cycle/milestone
(depending on the complexity of the spec), it may mean that he/she is
clearly oversubscribed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Neutron team will review the status of blueprints targeted for the
milestone during their weekly meeting to ensure a smooth progression of
the work planned. Blueprints for which resources cannot be identified
will have to be deferred.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In either case (a spec being required or not), once the discussion has
happened and there is positive consensus on the RFE, the report is &#8216;approved&#8217;,
and its tag will move from &#8216;rfe&#8217; to &#8216;rfe-approved&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">At this point, the RFE needs resources, and if none are identified for
some time the report will be marked incomplete.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As for setting the milestone (both for RFE bugs or blueprints), the current
milestone is always chosen, assuming that work will start as soon as the feature
is approved. Work that fails to complete by the defined milestone will roll
over automatically until it gets completed or abandoned.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the code fails to merge, the bug report may be marked as incomplete,
unassigned and untargeted, and it will be garbage collected by
the Launchpad Janitor if no-one takes over in time. Renewed interest in the
feature will have to go through RFE submission process once again.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the triaging (discussion is complete) and the RFE is approved, the tag goes from &#8216;rfe&#8217;
to &#8216;rfe-approved&#8217;, and at this point the bug report goes through the usual state transition.
Note, that the importance will be set to &#8216;wishlist&#8217;, to reflect the fact that the bug report
is indeed not a bug, but a new feature or enhancement. This will also help have RFEs that are
not followed up by a blueprint standout in the Launchpad <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/neutron/+milestones">milestone dashboards</a>.</p>
<p>The drivers team will be discussing the following bug reports during their IRC meeting:</p>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="rfe-submission-guidelines">
<h2>RFE Submission Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#rfe-submission-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into the guidelines for writing a good RFE, it is worth mentioning
that depending on your level of engagement with the Neutron project and your role
(user, developer, deployer, operator, etc.), you are more than welcome to have
a preliminary discussion of a potential RFE by reaching out to other people involved
in the project. This usually happens by posting mails on the relevant mailing
lists (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org">openstack-dev</a> - include [neutron] in
the subject) or on #openstack-neutron IRC channel on Freenode. If current ongoing
code reviews are related to your feature, posting comments/questions on gerrit
may also be a way to engage. Some amount of interaction with Neutron developers
will give you an idea of the plausibility and form of your RFE before you submit
it. That said, this is not mandatory.</p>
<p>When you submit a bug report on <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+filebug">https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+filebug</a>,
there are two fields that must be filled: &#8216;summary&#8217; and &#8216;further information&#8217;.
The &#8216;summary&#8217; must be brief enough to fit in one line: if you can&#8217;t describe it
in a few words it may mean that you are either trying to capture more than one
RFE at once, or that you are having a hard time defining what you are trying to
solve at all.</p>
<p>The &#8216;further information&#8217; section must be a description of what you would like
to see implemented in Neutron. The description should provide enough details for
a knowledgeable developer to understand what is the existing problem in the
current platform that needs to be addressed, or what is the enhancement that
would make the platform more capable, both for a functional and a non-functional
standpoint. To this aim it is important to describe &#8216;why&#8217; you believe the RFE
should be accepted, and motivate the reason why without it Neutron is a poorer
platform. The description should be self contained, and no external references
should be necessary to further explain the RFE.</p>
<p>In other words, when you write an RFE you should ask yourself the following
questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What is that I (specify what user - a user can be a human or another system)
cannot do today when interacting with Neutron? On the other hand, is there a
Neutron component X that is unable to accomplish something?</li>
<li>Is there something that you would like Neutron handle better, ie. in a more
scalable, or in a more reliable way?</li>
<li>What is that I would like to see happen after the RFE is accepted and
implemented?</li>
<li>Why do you think it is important?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are happy with what you wrote, add &#8216;rfe&#8217; as tag, and submit. Do not
worry, we are here to help you get it right! Happy hacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="missing-your-target">
<h2>Missing your target<a class="headerlink" href="#missing-your-target" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are occasions when a spec will be approved and the code will not land in
the cycle it was targeted at. For these cases, the work flow to get the spec
into the next release is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>During the RC window, the PTL will create a directory named &#8216;&lt;release&gt;&#8217; under
the &#8216;backlog&#8217; directory in the neutron specs repo, and he/she will move all
specs that did not make the release to this directory.</li>
<li>Anyone can propose a patch to neutron-specs which moves a spec from the
previous release into the new release directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specs which are moved in this way can be fast-tracked into the next
release. Please note that it is required to re-propose the spec for the new
release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The above process involves two places where any given feature can start to be
documented - namely in the RFE bug, and in the spec - and in addition to those
Neutron has a substantial <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/devref/index.html">developer reference guide</a> (aka
&#8216;devref&#8217;), and user-facing docs such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openstack.org/networking-guide/">networking guide</a>.  So it might be asked:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What is the relationship between all of those?</li>
<li>What is the point of devref documentation, if everything has already been
described in the spec?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers have been beautifully expressed in an <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-December/081458.html">openstack-dev post</a>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>RFE: &#8220;I want X&#8221;</li>
<li>Spec: &#8220;I plan to implement X like this&#8221;</li>
<li>devref: &#8220;How X is implemented and how to extend it&#8221;</li>
<li>OS docs: &#8220;API and guide for using X&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a feature X has been implemented, we shouldn&#8217;t have to go to back to its
RFE bug or spec to find information on it.  The devref may reuse a lot of
content from the spec, but the spec is not maintained and the implementation
may differ in some ways from what was intended when the spec was agreed.  The
devref should be kept current with refactorings, etc., of the implementation.</p>
<p>Devref content should be added as part of the implementation of a new feature.
Since the spec is not maintained after the feature is implemented, the devref
should include a maintained version of the information from the spec.</p>
<p>If a feature requires OS docs (4), the commit message for the feature patch
shall include &#8216;DocImpact&#8217;.  If the feature is purely a developer facing thing,
(4) is not needed.</p>
