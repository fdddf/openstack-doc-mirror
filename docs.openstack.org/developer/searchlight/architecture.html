<h1>Searchlight Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#searchlight-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="the-openstack-search-service">
<h2>The OpenStack Search Service<a class="headerlink" href="#the-openstack-search-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Searchlight is a microservice based architecture that provides advanced and
multi-tenant searching capabilities across multiple cloud services through
indexing into Elasticsearch. Once indexed, users are able to search through
all internal data associated with an OpenStack service through a single API
with a consistent interface. These searches can be quite complex, are blazingly
fast, and easily paginated.  Without Searchlight it can be necessary to make
calls to multiple services to retrieve resource information.</p>
<p>All documents in Elasticsearch are protected by Searchlight with role-based
access control (RBAC) for data security and protection. RBAC protection
prevents unauthorized users from accessing data that they are not permitted to
view. Searchlight uses RBAC in three ways to protect the data:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Network Restriction:</strong> Elasticsearch is not directly accessible. It
resides on a restricted network behind Searchlight. The only way to access
the data within Elasticsearch is indirectly through the Searchlight.
API endpoints. Users need to be authenticated to access these endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Document Separation:</strong> Each resource is indexed twice in Elasticsearch.
Once for the admin user and once for all others. The document associated
with the admin has all fields present. The document associated with
non-admins has all admin-only fields removed. This model prevents a
non-admin from viewing any admin-only fields since these fields are not
present in the document at all.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Query Protection:</strong> Searchlight will inject RBAC-based protection
into all queries before they get sent to Elasticsearch. In general the
pre-query RBAC injection will provide gross level protection. For example,
entire projects that the user does not have access to. See Figure 2.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Query Protection:</strong> Searchlight uses the RBAC-based protection to
filter the response to each query in order to remove any sensitive data
before returning the results to the eagerly waiting user. In general the
post-query RBAC filtering will provide fine level protection. For example,
specific fields within a document. See Figure 2.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The functionality provided by Searchlight differs greatly from the logging
capabilities of OpenStack. The logging services store predetermined messages
from the OpenStack services, as opposed to the dynamic, internal state of the
OpenStack services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="primary-users">
<h2>Primary Users<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary users are Horizon-based. This includes users accessing their
cloud projects (&#8220;tenants&#8221;) and cloud administrators (IT operations).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searchlight-components">
<h2>Searchlight Components<a class="headerlink" href="#searchlight-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Searchlight consists of multiple components. The components live in one of two
environments: externally on the end-user&#8217;s system or internally on an
OpenStack deployed system. Figure 1 illustrates how all of these components
interact.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Architecture Diagram</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Figure1.png" src="_images/Figure1.png" />
<p>Figure 1 shows the relationship between all of the Searchlight components. The
external Searchlight components are colored light-grey. The internal
Searchlight components are colored peach. The internal non-Searchlight
components are brightly colored, as are the arrows indicating the interfaces
for these components.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Searchlight UI:</strong> A plugin for Horizon that provides search support. Lives
externally on the end-user&#8217;s system.</li>
<li><strong>Searchlight User CLI (OpenStack Client plugin):</strong> Command-line interface
to the Searchlight API. Lives externally on the end-user&#8217;s system.</li>
<li><strong>Searchlight API:</strong> OpenStack Searchlight RESTful API. A separate process
running a WSGI web server on top of the python Searchlight framework. All
external access (for example, Horizon, browser, and CLI) go through the
Searchlight API. The Searchlight API performs read-only accesses of
Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>HAProxy:</strong> High availability load balancer and proxy server for the
Searchlight API component. HAProxy enables multiple instances of the
Searchlight API to run and allows for better performance, scalability, and
reliability of the Searchlight service.</li>
<li><strong>Searchlight Listener:</strong> A separate Searchlight process that is plugged
into the notification MQ for the OpenStack services. Whenever there is a
change in state for a resource type in an OpenStack service, a notification
is sent to the Searchlight Listener. This results in the OpenStack service
state being indexed into Elasticsearch as a document related to that
resource type (for example, OS::Nova::Server). The listener is never accessed
directly by any of the other Searchlight components.</li>
<li><strong>Searchlight Admin CLI (searchlight-manage):</strong> A separate process that
provides admin support for Searchlight. The main functionality is
re-indexing support. Connects to various OpenStack services and loads data
from them into the Elasticsearch indices. The admin needs to log in directly
to a Searchlight node and run the Searchlight Admin CLI from that node. The
Searchlight Admin CLI performs read/write accesses to Elasticsearch. Lives
internally on an OpenStack deployed system.</li>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch:</strong> A database service used to index information about
selected services. Elasticsearch is meant to be shared by multiple OpenStack
projects, not just Searchlight. This implies that there may be multiple
indices within Elasticsearch. All Elasticsearch indices used by Searchlight
are created in a way so as to be unique to Searchlight. This will prevent
any duplication between Searchlight and other OpenStack projects that may
be sharing Elasticsearch. Lives internally on an OpenStack deployed system.</li>
<li><strong>RabbitMQ:</strong> Messaging Queue used for accessing the OpenStack&#8217;s OSLO
notification MQ. Each OpenStack service will place notifications for any
state change in RabbitMQ. The Searchlight listener will pull this
notifications from RabbitMQ and process them. Lives internally on an
OpenStack deployed system. All access of the notification MQ is done
through OSLO messaging.</li>
<li><strong>OpenStack Services:</strong> Various OpenStack Services from which Searchlight
gathers information through internal plugins. The current list of supported
OpenStack services are: Cinder, Designate, Glance, Neutron, Nova, Swift.
Searchlight accesses the services as an admin, not as a regular user.
This admin access is required for the extra privileges that are needed,
for example, to access objects across projects (&#8220;tenants&#8221;). The credentials
for the admin are stored in the config files.</li>
<li><strong>OpenStack Service Plugins:</strong> Each OpenStack service mentioned above has
one or more associated plugins. These plugins live in Searchlight and not in
the OpenStack service. The plugins are based on a resource type and not on
the OpenStack service. For example, the Cinder Service has two resource types
used by Searchlight: OS::Cinder::Volume and OS::Cinder::Snapshot. This
results in two plugins for the Cinder service. The architecture is the same
for each plugin. The plugins are not a separate process. The plugins live
within the Searchlight listener and the Searchlight Admin CLI components.</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbered arrows represent the interfaces between the components. These
interfaces are fully described in Table 1.</p>

<div class="section" id="searchlight-eco-system">
<h2>Searchlight Eco-System<a class="headerlink" href="#searchlight-eco-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Searchlight Eco-system is illuminated by Figure 2. We will step through
each stage of the Searchlight life-cycle to further explore how the various
components interact with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Stage:</strong> This stage is when Searchlight gets instantiated by the
admin dev ops. Even though the steps are mentioned as if they are manual steps,
they are all done within a deployment process. More deployment stage options
are discussed in Figure 4.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The OpenStack services (for example, Nova, Neutron) are started. These
services are used by Searchlight, but are not a part of the Searchlight
Eco-system. The admin will set up the configuration files for all services
that are used by Searchlight, including enabling the notifications that will
later be consumed by Searchlight.</li>
<li>Elasticsearch is started. This analytics engine is used by Searchlight, but
it is not a part of the Searchlight Eco-system. As a note, other services
may also be using Elasticsearch.</li>
<li>The admin sets up the Searchlight configuration file.</li>
<li>The initial indexing for Searchlight occurs (component 2 in Figure 2). This
happens when the admin runs the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">searchlight-manage</span> <span class="pre">index</span> <span class="pre">sync</span></code> on
a Searchlight node. Searchlight will pull the data from the OpenStack
service&#8217;s API and index it into Elasticsearch.</li>
<li>The Searchlight listeners are started (component 3 in Figure 2). This
happens when the admin runs the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">searchlight-listener</span></code> At this
point, Searchlight is notified of any state changes that occurs in the
services. The OpenStack services will push the data to Searchlight, which
in turn will index that data into Elasticsearch.</li>
<li>The Searchlight API service is started (component 1 in Figure 2). This
happens when the admin runs the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">searchlight-api</span></code> At this point,
the Searchlight API is live and anyone can start making queries to
Searchlight.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Running Stage (automatic):</strong> This stage consumes the vast majority of the
Searchlight life cycle. The running stage is further highlighted in Figure 3.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Searchlight listeners are actively receiving notifications from the
OpenStack services whenever there is a state change.</li>
<li>The Searchlight API service is actively receiving queries from Horizon apps
and users.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Maintenance Stage (manual):</strong> This stage occurs when the admin needs to
analyze the state of Searchlight Eco-system or make corrections to it.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>To verify there are no orphaned Elasticsearch indices, the admin can view
the Elasticsearch indices being used by Searchlight using the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">searchlight-manage</span></code> command. Any orphaned indices will be taken
care of through Elasticsearch and not through Searchlight.
See <a class="reference internal" href="indexingservice.html#es-index-cleanup"><span>Elasticsearch Index Cleanup</span></a>.</li>
<li>If the Elasticsearch data is no longer coherent with the OpenStack
services, the admin will need to re-index Elasticsearch. This is done by
running the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">searchlight-manage</span></code> similarly to step 4 in
the deployment stage. See <a class="reference internal" href="indexingservice.html#es-bulk-indexing"><span>Bulk indexing</span></a>.</li>

<h2>Searchlight Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#searchlight-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main portion of the Eco-system, the running stage, is showcased in Figure
3. The diagram is from the viewpoint of the users of the Eco-system.</p>
<p>The clients will access the OpenStack services. This could include issuing
commands to create a new server, delete a volume or modify a networking subnet.
The commands can be sent directly to the OpenStack service&#8217;s API or indirectly
through the Horizon dashboard. Once these commands are executed by the
OpenStack services, the OpenStack services will notify Searchlight of the
resulting state changes.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the user can make queries of Searchlight to better understand
the entire OpenStack Eco-system. These queries can be made directly through the
Searchlight API or indirectly through the Horizon dashboard.</p>

<div class="section" id="searchlight-scaling">
<h2>Searchlight Scaling<a class="headerlink" href="#searchlight-scaling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When deploying Searchlight, the Eco-system is scaled in multiple ways. This
scaling is done for both performance and reliability. Both the Searchlight API
and the Searchlight listener are stateless microservices. This makes it easier
to scale them. Figure 4 shows this in glorious color.</p>
<p>Searchlight API Services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Multiple instances of the Searchlight API service can be deployed and placed
behind a load balancer. The load balancer hides the details of the
Searchlight API services from the user. All user API access will go through
the load balancer. In addition, the WSGI web service has multiple threads
handling all requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Searchlight Listeners:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are multiple notification workers that are receiving messages from the
OpenStack services. The number of workers can be statically specified in the
Searchlight configuration file. In addition, each type of resource indexed by
Searchlight can be scaled independently by spawning different processes with
different configuration files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elasticsearch:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Elasticsearch is deployed with multiple nodes in a cluster. Each cluster can
also have multiple shards and replicas. The number of nodes, shards and
replicas are specified in the Elasticsearch configuration file. But the
number of shards and replicas can be overwritten on a per-index basis by
Searchlight. See <a class="reference internal" href="indexingservice.html#indexing-model"><span>Indexing model</span></a></li>

<h2>Security Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#security-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Searchlight&#8217;s security and threat analysis can be viewed through multiple control points.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Audit:</strong> Searchlight performs logging and sends logs to the Logstash
central logging service.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Searchlight requires a valid domain, username and
password to access the services. Keystone handles authentication and
authorization via session tokens. Note: No authentication is used for
Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Searchlight provides access to user information.
Authentication and authorization is handled by Keystone.</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong>  Searchlight uses HAProxy. The users can deploy
Elasticsearch in a high-availability mode if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Searchlight API is configured to use TLS, traffic
between hosts is communicated using TLS. Data and config files protected
via filesystem controls. Note: No TLS between Searchlight and Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Data is stored in Elasticsearch, but not backed up. The data
is always accessible from the OpenStack services themselves. If data in
Elasticsearch ever gets corrupted or out of sync, a resync will restore the
data integrity.</li>
