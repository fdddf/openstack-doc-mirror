<h1>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Hardware selection involves three key areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Compute</li>
<li>Network</li>
<li>Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Hardware for a general purpose OpenStack cloud should reflect a cloud
with no pre-defined usage model, designed to run a wide variety of
applications with varying resource usage requirements. These
applications include any of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>RAM-intensive</li>
<li>CPU-intensive</li>
<li>Storage-intensive</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain hardware form factors may better suit a general purpose
OpenStack cloud due to the requirement for equal (or nearly equal)
balance of resources. Server hardware must provide the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Equal (or nearly equal) balance of compute capacity (RAM and CPU)</li>
<li>Network capacity (number and speed of links)</li>
<li>Storage capacity (gigabytes or terabytes as well as <a class="reference internal" href="common/glossary.html#term-input-output-operations-per-second-iops"><span class="xref std std-term">Input/Output
Operations Per Second (IOPS)</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluate server hardware around four conflicting dimensions:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Server density</dt>
<dd>A measure of how many servers can fit into a given measure of
physical space, such as a rack unit [U].</dd>
<dt>Resource capacity</dt>
<dd>The number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, or amount of deliverable
storage.</dd>
<dt>Expandability</dt>
<dd>Limit of additional resources you can add to a server.</dd>
<dt>Cost</dt>
<dd>The relative purchase price of the hardware weighted against the
level of design effort needed to build the system.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Increasing server density means sacrificing resource capacity or
expandability, however, increasing resource capacity and expandability
increases cost and decreases server density. As a result, determining
the best server hardware for a general purpose OpenStack architecture
means understanding how choice of form factor will impact the rest of
the design. The following list outlines the form factors to choose from:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Blade servers typically support dual-socket multi-core CPUs. Blades
also offer outstanding density.</li>
<li>1U rack-mounted servers occupy only a single rack unit. Their
benefits include high density, support for dual-socket multi-core
CPUs, and support for reasonable RAM amounts. This form factor offers
limited storage capacity, limited network capacity, and limited
expandability.</li>
<li>2U rack-mounted servers offer the expanded storage and networking
capacity that 1U servers tend to lack, but with a corresponding
decrease in server density (half the density offered by 1U
rack-mounted servers).</li>
<li>Larger rack-mounted servers, such as 4U servers, will tend to offer
even greater CPU capacity, often supporting four or even eight CPU
sockets. These servers often have much greater expandability so will
provide the best option for upgradability. This means, however, that
the servers have a much lower server density and a much greater
hardware cost.</li>
<li><em>Sled servers</em> are rack-mounted servers that support multiple
independent servers in a single 2U or 3U enclosure. This form factor
offers increased density over typical 1U-2U rack-mounted servers but
tends to suffer from limitations in the amount of storage or network
capacity each individual server supports.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best form factor for server hardware supporting a general purpose
OpenStack cloud is driven by outside business and cost factors. No
single reference architecture applies to all implementations; the
decision must flow from user requirements, technical considerations, and
operational considerations. Here are some of the key factors that
influence the selection of server hardware:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Instance density</dt>
<dd>Sizing is an important consideration for a general purpose OpenStack
cloud. The expected or anticipated number of instances that each
hypervisor can host is a common meter used in sizing the deployment.
The selected server hardware needs to support the expected or
anticipated instance density.</dd>
<dt>Host density</dt>
<dd>Physical data centers have limited physical space, power, and
cooling. The number of hosts (or hypervisors) that can be fitted
into a given metric (rack, rack unit, or floor tile) is another
important method of sizing. Floor weight is an often overlooked
consideration. The data center floor must be able to support the
weight of the proposed number of hosts within a rack or set of
racks. These factors need to be applied as part of the host density
calculation and server hardware selection.</dd>
<dt>Power density</dt>
<dd>Data centers have a specified amount of power fed to a given rack or
set of racks. Older data centers may have a power density as power
as low as 20 AMPs per rack, while more recent data centers can be
architected to support power densities as high as 120 AMP per rack.
The selected server hardware must take power density into account.</dd>
<dt>Network connectivity</dt>
<dd>The selected server hardware must have the appropriate number of
network connections, as well as the right type of network
connections, in order to support the proposed architecture. Ensure
that, at a minimum, there are at least two diverse network
connections coming into each rack.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The selection of form factors or architectures affects the selection of
server hardware. Ensure that the selected server hardware is configured
to support enough storage capacity (or storage expandability) to match
the requirements of selected scale-out storage solution. Similarly, the
network architecture impacts the server hardware selection and vice
versa.</p>
<div class="section" id="selecting-storage-hardware">
<h2>Selecting storage hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-storage-hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Determine storage hardware architecture by selecting specific storage
architecture. Determine the selection of storage architecture by
evaluating possible solutions against the critical factors, the user
requirements, technical considerations, and operational considerations.
Incorporate the following facts into your storage architecture:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Cost</dt>
<dd>Storage can be a significant portion of the overall system cost. For
an organization that is concerned with vendor support, a commercial
storage solution is advisable, although it comes with a higher price
tag. If initial capital expenditure requires minimization, designing
a system based on commodity hardware would apply. The trade-off is
potentially higher support costs and a greater risk of
incompatibility and interoperability issues.</dd>
<dt>Scalability</dt>
<dd>Scalability, along with expandability, is a major consideration in a
general purpose OpenStack cloud. It might be difficult to predict
the final intended size of the implementation as there are no
established usage patterns for a general purpose cloud. It might
become necessary to expand the initial deployment in order to
accommodate growth and user demand.</dd>
<dt>Expandability</dt>
<dd>Expandability is a major architecture factor for storage solutions
with general purpose OpenStack cloud. A storage solution that
expands to 50&nbsp;PB is considered more expandable than a solution that
only scales to 10&nbsp;PB. This meter is related to scalability, which is
the measure of a solution&#8217;s performance as it expands.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Using a scale-out storage solution with direct-attached storage (DAS) in
the servers is well suited for a general purpose OpenStack cloud. Cloud
services requirements determine your choice of scale-out solution. You
need to determine if a single, highly expandable and highly vertical,
scalable, centralized storage array is suitable for your design. After
determining an approach, select the storage hardware based on this
criteria.</p>
<p>This list expands upon the potential impacts for including a particular
storage architecture (and corresponding storage hardware) into the
design for a general purpose OpenStack cloud:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Connectivity</dt>
<dd>Ensure that, if storage protocols other than Ethernet are part of
the storage solution, the appropriate hardware has been selected. If
a centralized storage array is selected, ensure that the hypervisor
will be able to connect to that storage array for image storage.</dd>
<dt>Usage</dt>
<dd>How the particular storage architecture will be used is critical for
determining the architecture. Some of the configurations that will
influence the architecture include whether it will be used by the
hypervisors for ephemeral instance storage or if OpenStack Object
Storage will use it for object storage.</dd>
<dt>Instance and image locations</dt>
<dd>Where instances and images will be stored will influence the
architecture.</dd>
<dt>Server hardware</dt>
<dd>If the solution is a scale-out storage architecture that includes
DAS, it will affect the server hardware selection. This could ripple
into the decisions that affect host density, instance density, power
density, OS-hypervisor, management tools and others.</dd>
</dl>
<p>General purpose OpenStack cloud has multiple options. The key factors
that will have an influence on selection of storage hardware for a
general purpose OpenStack cloud are as follows:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Capacity</dt>
<dd>Hardware resources selected for the resource nodes should be capable
of supporting enough storage for the cloud services. Defining the
initial requirements and ensuring the design can support adding
capacity is important. Hardware nodes selected for object storage
should be capable of support a large number of inexpensive disks
with no reliance on RAID controller cards. Hardware nodes selected
for block storage should be capable of supporting high speed storage
solutions and RAID controller cards to provide performance and
redundancy to storage at a hardware level. Selecting hardware RAID
controllers that automatically repair damaged arrays will assist
with the replacement and repair of degraded or deleted storage
devices.</dd>
<dt>Performance</dt>
<dd>Disks selected for object storage services do not need to be fast
performing disks. We recommend that object storage nodes take
advantage of the best cost per terabyte available for storage.
Contrastingly, disks chosen for block storage services should take
advantage of performance boosting features that may entail the use
of SSDs or flash storage to provide high performance block storage
pools. Storage performance of ephemeral disks used for instances
should also be taken into consideration.</dd>
<dt>Fault tolerance</dt>
<dd>Object storage resource nodes have no requirements for hardware
fault tolerance or RAID controllers. It is not necessary to plan for
fault tolerance within the object storage hardware because the
object storage service provides replication between zones as a
feature of the service. Block storage nodes, compute nodes, and
cloud controllers should all have fault tolerance built in at the
hardware level by making use of hardware RAID controllers and
varying levels of RAID configuration. The level of RAID chosen
should be consistent with the performance and availability
requirements of the cloud.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-networking-hardware">
<h2>Selecting networking hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-networking-hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Selecting network architecture determines which network hardware will be
used. Networking software is determined by the selected networking
hardware.</p>
<p>There are more subtle design impacts that need to be considered. The
selection of certain networking hardware (and the networking software)
affects the management tools that can be used. There are exceptions to
this; the rise of <em>open</em> networking software that supports a range of
networking hardware means that there are instances where the
relationship between networking hardware and networking software are not
as tightly defined.</p>
<p>Some of the key considerations that should be included in the selection
of networking hardware include:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Port count</dt>
<dd>The design will require networking hardware that has the requisite
port count.</dd>
<dt>Port density</dt>
<dd>The network design will be affected by the physical space that is
required to provide the requisite port count. A higher port density
is preferred, as it leaves more rack space for compute or storage
components that may be required by the design. This can also lead
into concerns about fault domains and power density that should be
considered. Higher density switches are more expensive and should
also be considered, as it is important not to over design the
network if it is not required.</dd>
<dt>Port speed</dt>
<dd>The networking hardware must support the proposed network speed, for
example: 1&nbsp;GbE, 10&nbsp;GbE, or 40&nbsp;GbE (or even 100&nbsp;GbE).</dd>
<dt>Redundancy</dt>
<dd>The level of network hardware redundancy required is influenced by
the user requirements for high availability and cost considerations.
Network redundancy can be achieved by adding redundant power
supplies or paired switches. If this is a requirement, the hardware
will need to support this configuration.</dd>
<dt>Power requirements</dt>
<dd>Ensure that the physical data center provides the necessary power
for the selected network hardware.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There is no single best practice architecture for the networking
hardware supporting a general purpose OpenStack cloud that will apply to
all implementations. Some of the key factors that will have a strong
influence on selection of networking hardware include:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Connectivity</dt>
<dd>All nodes within an OpenStack cloud require network connectivity. In
some cases, nodes require access to more than one network segment.
The design must encompass sufficient network capacity and bandwidth
to ensure that all communications within the cloud, both north-south
and east-west traffic have sufficient resources available.</dd>
<dt>Scalability</dt>
<dd>The network design should encompass a physical and logical network
design that can be easily expanded upon. Network hardware should
offer the appropriate types of interfaces and speeds that are
required by the hardware nodes.</dd>
<dt>Availability</dt>
<dd>To ensure that access to nodes within the cloud is not interrupted,
we recommend that the network architecture identify any single
points of failure and provide some level of redundancy or fault
tolerance. With regard to the network infrastructure itself, this
often involves use of networking protocols such as LACP, VRRP or
others to achieve a highly available network connection. In
addition, it is important to consider the networking implications on
API availability. In order to ensure that the APIs, and potentially
other services in the cloud are highly available, we recommend you
design a load balancing solution within the network architecture to
accommodate for these requirements.</dd>

<h2>Software selection<a class="headerlink" href="#software-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Software selection for a general purpose OpenStack architecture design
needs to include these three areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Operating system (OS) and hypervisor</li>
<li>OpenStack components</li>
<li>Supplemental software</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="operating-system-and-hypervisor">
<h2>Operating system and hypervisor<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-system-and-hypervisor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The operating system (OS) and hypervisor have a significant impact on
the overall design. Selecting a particular operating system and
hypervisor can directly affect server hardware selection. Make sure the
storage hardware and topology support the selected operating system and
hypervisor combination. Also ensure the networking hardware selection
and topology will work with the chosen operating system and hypervisor
combination.</p>
<p>Some areas that could be impacted by the selection of OS and hypervisor
include:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Cost</dt>
<dd>Selecting a commercially supported hypervisor, such as Microsoft
Hyper-V, will result in a different cost model rather than
community-supported open source hypervisors including
<a class="reference internal" href="common/glossary.html#term-kernel-based-vm-kvm"><span class="xref std std-term">KVM</span></a>, Kinstance or <a class="reference internal" href="common/glossary.html#term-xen"><span class="xref std std-term">Xen</span></a>. When
comparing open source OS solutions, choosing Ubuntu over Red Hat
(or vice versa) will have an impact on cost due to support
contracts.</dd>
<dt>Supportability</dt>
<dd>Depending on the selected hypervisor, staff should have the
appropriate training and knowledge to support the selected OS and
hypervisor combination. If they do not, training will need to be
provided which could have a cost impact on the design.</dd>
<dt>Management tools</dt>
<dd>The management tools used for Ubuntu and Kinstance differ from the
management tools for VMware vSphere. Although both OS and hypervisor
combinations are supported by OpenStack, there will be very
different impacts to the rest of the design as a result of the
selection of one combination versus the other.</dd>
<dt>Scale and performance</dt>
<dd>Ensure that selected OS and hypervisor combinations meet the
appropriate scale and performance requirements. The chosen
architecture will need to meet the targeted instance-host ratios
with the selected OS-hypervisor combinations.</dd>
<dt>Security</dt>
<dd>Ensure that the design can accommodate regular periodic
installations of application security patches while maintaining
required workloads. The frequency of security patches for the
proposed OS-hypervisor combination will have an impact on
performance and the patch installation process could affect
maintenance windows.</dd>
<dt>Supported features</dt>
<dd>Determine which features of OpenStack are required. This will often
determine the selection of the OS-hypervisor combination. Some
features are only available with specific operating systems or
hypervisors.</dd>
<dt>Interoperability</dt>
<dd>You will need to consider how the OS and hypervisor combination
interactions with other operating systems and hypervisors, including
other software solutions. Operational troubleshooting tools for one
OS-hypervisor combination may differ from the tools used for another
OS-hypervisor combination and, as a result, the design will need to
address if the two sets of tools need to interoperate.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openstack-components">
<h2>OpenStack components<a class="headerlink" href="#openstack-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Selecting which OpenStack components are included in the overall design
is important. Some OpenStack components, like compute and Image service,
are required in every architecture. Other components, like
Orchestration, are not always required.</p>
<p>Excluding certain OpenStack components can limit or constrain the
functionality of other components. For example, if the architecture
includes Orchestration but excludes Telemetry, then the design will not
be able to take advantage of Orchestrations&#8217; auto scaling functionality.
It is important to research the component interdependencies in
conjunction with the technical requirements before deciding on the final
architecture.</p>
<div class="section" id="networking-software">
<h3>Networking software<a class="headerlink" href="#networking-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenStack Networking (neutron) provides a wide variety of networking
services for instances. There are many additional networking software
packages that can be useful when managing OpenStack components. Some
examples include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Software to provide load balancing</li>
<li>Network redundancy protocols</li>
<li>Routing daemons</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these software packages are described in more detail in the
OpenStack High Availability Guide (refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/ha-guide/networking-ha.html">OpenStack network
nodes
chapter</a> of
the OpenStack High Availability Guide).</p>
<p>For a general purpose OpenStack cloud, the OpenStack infrastructure
components need to be highly available. If the design does not include
hardware load balancing, networking software packages like HAProxy will
need to be included.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="management-software">
<h3>Management software<a class="headerlink" href="#management-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Selected supplemental software solution impacts and affects the overall
OpenStack cloud design. This includes software for providing clustering,
logging, monitoring and alerting.</p>
<p>Inclusion of clustering software, such as Corosync or Pacemaker, is
determined primarily by the availability requirements. The impact of
including (or not including) these software packages is primarily
determined by the availability of the cloud infrastructure and the
complexity of supporting the configuration after it is deployed. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/ha-guide/">OpenStack High Availability
Guide</a> provides more details on
the installation and configuration of Corosync and Pacemaker, should
these packages need to be included in the design.</p>
<p>Requirements for logging, monitoring, and alerting are determined by
operational considerations. Each of these sub-categories includes a
number of various options.</p>
<p>If these software packages are required, the design must account for the
additional resource consumption (CPU, RAM, storage, and network
bandwidth). Some other potential design impacts include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>OS-hypervisor combination: Ensure that the selected logging,
monitoring, or alerting tools support the proposed OS-hypervisor
combination.</li>
<li>Network hardware: The network hardware selection needs to be
supported by the logging, monitoring, and alerting software.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="database-software">
<h3>Database software<a class="headerlink" href="#database-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenStack components often require access to back-end database services
to store state and configuration information. Selecting an appropriate
back-end database that satisfies the availability and fault tolerance
requirements of the OpenStack services is required. OpenStack services
supports connecting to a database that is supported by the SQLAlchemy
python drivers, however, most common database deployments make use of
MySQL or variations of it. We recommend that the database, which
provides back-end service within a general purpose cloud, be made highly
available when using an available technology which can accomplish that
goal.</p>
