<!--
I'm Monty Taylor and this is Jim Blair. We're with OpenStack and run the
core developer infrastructure for the project, including the Code Review
and Continuous Integration systems, which is what we're here to talk to you
about today.

OpenStack's developer infrastructure has a lineage that is mostly based on
what we used in Drizzle, with some things we learned from the bzr/launchpad
teams, and then a bunch of taking the next step. The key parts are that we
manage the project on Launchpad using just about all of the features that
are there- bugs, complete with use of release series and milestones,
blueprints, ppas, translations. Drizzle was one of the first people who
weren't Ubuntu to use blueprints extensively - OpenStack continues the
trend.

One of the biggest philosophical points we took from Drizzle was having a
consistent and automated developer infrastructure. Trunk should never break-
code should be clean, and this should be enforced by computers. In OpenStack
we started using tarmac to further automate the processing of approved merge
requests and only letting code be merged if it passes tests (we call this
trunk gating) and it served us well for our first two releases. 

Then we had a revolt in OpenStack because a indeterminate amount of people
hated bzr, and a possibly intersecting set of people who found launchpad's
code reviews insufficient. (speed and lack of in-line review comments were
the two biggest consistent complaints) So we were tasked with replacing code
hosting and code reviews with something else (the main suggestion being
github, which we did investigate)

As we looked at the situation, we knew several things:
 - launchpad had no git support, so staying with Launchpad and just moving
   code to git was a non-starter
 - we wanted to stay on Launchpad for bugs and blueprints, as the features
   contained within them do not have an analogue on other systems
 - we wanted to keep a system where we gated trunk.

Long story short - github was an unusable choice for our workflow for two
reasons:
 1) It had no workflow concept of a pull request being "approved" or
 "rejected" - only textual votes in the comments.
 2) The folks at github were unwilling to add that state concept, and github
 is not open source, so we couldn't do it ourselves

Gerrit, from google and used for Android development, on the other hand, did
have the workflow elements that we needed (and a few new ones we're going to
point out) So we moved forward with gerrit, and then started doing work to
integrate it with Launchpad ... and we're pretty happy with the results
(honestly, happier than I expected to be)

-----

First of all, we wanted bug integration just like we had with Launchpad
before. So we wrote a gerrit-side hook which examines the commit message for
references to bugs (similar to closing bugs in debian/changelog files) and
we have it send a gpg-signed email to the bug with information about the
code review instance in gerrit, and commands to operate the appropriate
state-changes needed on the bug. We've currently decided that a bug will
transition to In Progress when a new review mentioning the bug is pushed,
and when that review is accepted and merged, will transition to Fix
Committed. 

Next, something I've always wanted with launchpad was the same kind of
integration with blueprints - so we added that too - this time using
launchpad API. When a commit message mentions a blueprint, we add a set of
text to the whiteboard listing links to the work in progress.

We configured our gerrit to use launchpad openid for SSO, and we have a
script which pulls launchpad user and team information for all teams that
are members of ~openstack - so we're able to keep a single point of ACL
information.

Gerrit has a workflow state that launchad doesn't, which is a verified
state. So a review can be voted on, it can be approved or rejected, and it
can be verified or not. Only a review that is both approved and verified
gets merged.

Possibly most important is the Jenkins trigger plugin, which actually
listens actively to the even stream from gerrit, so instead of polling an
API to see if there are any interesting things to do - the Jenkins gerrit
plugin takes action immediately. It's also intelligent enough to know that
if there are three jobs that are all tied to the same gerrit event, that
they all need to pass in order for the calling event to be considered
successful. This makes for excellent jenkins-level parallelism.

-----

Why are we telling you about this?

Launchpad is awesome, but there are some integration points that would make
our lives either easier, or the overall meta system more complete.

Also, people are using git a lot these days - and I think we've got a good
model for how those people can use launchpad.

In order for us to have been able to build an equivilantly strong and
resilient system using pure bzr/launchpad, we would have needed three
things:
 - subscribably event triggers. We do a lot of things- and we have seen java
   thread starvation just from having a bazillion things polling
   launchpad/bzr all the time
 - verified status in merge requests. I didn't know I needed this until I
   had it, but it makes perfect sense. The state of the code being verified
   as working is different information from the patch being accepted as
   approved. It also allows an automated system to track where the state of
   a thing is right now
 - non-python language bindings for lp api (and I don't mean go - I
   specifically mean java) Jenkins is deeply pluggable, but that's all
   meaningless if you can't call the API from it. Hell - you should see the
   github plugin for jenkins - it's pretty baller. (oh, and the launchpad
   wadl blows up all of the java wadl reading/generation tools)

In order to build our current system without gerrit:
 - first class git support in launchpad

Other nice things:
 - Foreign merge props. Launchpad was ground-breaking in its thoughts that
   it would integrate with whatever upstream was doing dev in, and this can
   be seen in the support for upstream bug trackers. Understanding that
   upstream might be using a system for code review and being able to follow
   that might be nice (start with gerrit and github here)
 - mirrored branches - currently there is a delay in launchpad git branch
   mirroring, and you can also only mirror master. Additionally, an upstream
   branch is associated with a person/team, so if jim here decides to create
   a mirrored branch of openstack/nova from github, I become unable to
   create one of those in the ~openstack project. oops.
 - codee branch/review integration with blueprints (without having to click
   a bunch)
 - blueprint external metadata links (we're having to hack whiteboard
   messages right now)

<!--
I'm going to give you a 30 second history for those of you who don't know me
or how the project got to where it is today. In 2008, Chad Miller and I
convinced MySQL to move from Bitkeeper to bzr/launchpad. It was a move that
was (ironically) just about code hosting, as bugs were done in the MySQL bug
tracker and MySQL used a system called WorkLog for what blueprints are used
for. Shortly after Brian Aker forked MySQL to start Drizzle, and as we were
setting that up, we decided to stay with bzr, which made the decision to
locate all of our infrastructure on Launchpad. We became one of the first
set of people who weren't Ubuntu itself to actually use blueprint
extensively, and used just about every feature of launchpad.

Last year, when we started OpenStack, the team at Rackspace who were in
charge of putting the project together were three of us from Drizzle, plus
Rick Clark and Soren Hansen who you all know have strong Ubuntu backgrounds.
So we decided to stick with a Launchpad centric model, and again made strong
use of all of the Launchpad features - including blueprints, release series,
milestones, PPAs and. translations. I imagine someone even uses answers from
time to time.

Along side of all of this, with OpenStack we automated a process that we had
been doing by hand in Drizzle, which is a concept we refer to as trunk
gating. Essentially, this means that we test all code _before_ merge, with
the theory that every commit to trunk should be golden. I could babble about
why that's important for QA or release management, but the real gold has to
do with streamlining the workflow of an individual developer. If all of the
tests always run on trunk, then a developer can be certain that any test
failures are caused by their code and are something that they should feel
responsibility to fix. In general, this is a Good Thing.

To gate trunk, we had jenkins run tarmac, which would request approved merge
requests, test them, and then complete the merge on successful test run.
----------------

So what does a patch lifecycle look like for OpenStack?

A developer writes a patch, and then commits it.

In the commit message, he mentions any bug or blueprint he's working on.

He submits it for review. With gerrit, this is done via git push - but we
have a helper program we wrote which does some fancy things.

If the commit message mentioned a bug, we update the bug. If it mentioned a
blueprint, we update the blueprint.

Peer review of the patch happens.

If the patch is approved, jenkins is trigger and runs tests on the patch.

Jenkins votes on the patch with verified status or with a negative code
review comment.

Gerrit completes the merge. Updates bug and blueprint status.

SO - all the dev needs to do is write patches, push them to a location and
respond to code reviews. All of the rest of the meta-information tracking
that's necessary is taken care of.
