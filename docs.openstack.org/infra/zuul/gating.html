<h1>Project Gating<a class="headerlink" href="#project-gating" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Traditionally, many software development projects merge changes from
developers into the repository, and then identify regressions
resulting from those changes (perhaps by running a test suite with a
continuous integration system such as Jenkins), followed by more
patches to fix those bugs.  When the mainline of development is
broken, it can be very frustrating for developers and can cause lost
productivity, particularly so when the number of contributors or
contributions is large.</p>
<p>The process of gating attempts to prevent changes that introduce
regressions from being merged.  This keeps the mainline of development
open and working for all developers, and only when a change is
confirmed to work without disruption is it merged.</p>
<p>Many projects practice an informal method of gating where developers
with mainline commit access ensure that a test suite runs before
merging a change.  With more developers, more changes, and more
comprehensive test suites, that process does not scale very well, and
is not the best use of a developer&#8217;s time.  Zuul can help automate
this process, with a particular emphasis on ensuring large numbers of
changes are tested correctly.</p>
<p>Zuul was designed to handle the workflow of the OpenStack project, but
can be used with any project.</p>
<div class="section" id="testing-in-parallel">
<h2>Testing in parallel<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-in-parallel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A particular focus of Zuul is ensuring correctly ordered testing of
changes in parallel.  A gating system should always test each change
applied to the tip of the branch exactly as it is going to be merged.
A simple way to do that would be to test one change at a time, and
merge it only if it passes tests.  That works very well, but if
changes take a long time to test, developers may have to wait a long
time for their changes to make it into the repository.  With some
projects, it may take hours to test changes, and it is easy for
developers to create changes at a rate faster than they can be tested
and merged.</p>
<p>Zuul&#8217;s DependentPipelineManager allows for parallel execution of test
jobs for gating while ensuring changes are tested correctly, exactly
as if they had been tested one at a time.  It does this by performing
speculative execution of test jobs; it assumes that all jobs will
succeed and tests them in parallel accordingly.  If they do succeed,
they can all be merged.  However, if one fails, then changes that were
expecting it to succeed are re-tested without the failed change.  In
the best case, as many changes as execution contexts are available may
be tested in parallel and merged at once.  In the worst case, changes
are tested one at a time (as each subsequent change fails, changes
behind it start again).  In practice, the OpenStack project observes
something closer to the best case.</p>
<p>For example, if a core developer approves five changes in rapid
succession:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">E</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Zuul queues those changes in the order they were approved, and notes
that each subsequent change depends on the one ahead of it merging:</p>
<div><img height="120" src="_images/blockdiag-74cb4b667d015ecf2096ef0f7f6fe0ef44d49fd0.png" width="440" /></div><p>Zuul then starts immediately testing all of the changes in parallel.
But in the case of changes that depend on others, it instructs the
test system to include the changes ahead of it, with the assumption
they pass.  That means jobs testing change <em>B</em> include change <em>A</em> as
well:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Jobs for A: merge change A, then test
Jobs for B: merge changes A and B, then test
Jobs for C: merge changes A, B and C, then test
Jobs for D: merge changes A, B, C and D, then test
Jobs for E: merge changes A, B, C, D and E, then test
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Hence jobs triggered to tests A will only test A and ignore B, C, D:</p>
<div><img height="120" src="_images/blockdiag-04cf0d347a6f3d86e55f4ba0c6178bdaf259f46e.png" width="520" /></div><p>The jobs for E would include the whole dependency chain: A, B, C, D, and E.
E will be tested assuming A, B, C, and D passed:</p>
<div><img height="120" src="_images/blockdiag-ea8dfe88204552040456bb63924429dc1d2f6f87.png" width="520" /></div><p>If changes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> pass tests (green), and <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>E</em> fail (red):</p>
<div><img height="120" src="_images/blockdiag-e65fd5a3b000153ec13b37654b3edf10dc1ed64d.png" width="520" /></div><p>Zuul will merge change <em>A</em> followed by change <em>B</em>, leaving this queue:</p>

result of a defect in <em>D</em> or <em>C</em>:</p>
<div><img height="120" src="_images/blockdiag-06407e036af2d3ed724a134a91168dd91b6b3449.png" width="280" /></div><p>Since <em>C</em> failed, Zuul will report its failure and drop <em>C</em> from the queue,
keeping D and E:</p>
<div><img height="120" src="_images/blockdiag-e602b65a838f5efe4c2492212571af2571fcbb63.png" width="200" /></div><p>This queue is the same as if two new changes had just arrived, so Zuul
starts the process again testing <em>D</em> against the tip of the branch, and
<em>E</em> against <em>D</em>:</p>

<div class="section" id="cross-project-testing">
<h2>Cross Project Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-project-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When your projects are closely coupled together, you want to make sure
changes entering the gate are going to be tested with the version of
other projects currently enqueued in the gate (since they will
eventually be merged and might introduce breaking features).</p>
<p>Such relationships can be defined in Zuul configuration by registering
a job in a DependentPipeline of several projects. Whenever a change
enters such a pipeline, it will create references for the other
projects as well.  As an example, given a main project <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acme</span></tt> and a
plugin <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plugin</span></tt> you can define a job <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acme-tests</span></tt> which should be
run for both projects:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pipelines</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>

     <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">acme-tests</span>  <span class="c1"># Register job again</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Whenever a change enters the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gate</span></tt> pipeline queue, Zuul creates a reference
for it.  For each subsequent change, an additional reference is created for the
changes ahead in the queue.  As a result, you will always be able to fetch the
future state of your project dependencies for each change in the queue.</p>
<p>Based on the pipeline and project definitions above, three changes are
inserted in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gate</span></tt> pipeline with the associated references:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="27%" />
<col width="23%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="30%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Change</th>
<th class="head">Project</th>
<th class="head">Branch</th>
<th class="head">Zuul Ref.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Change 1</td>
<td>acme</td>
<td>master</td>
<td>master/Z1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Change 2</td>
<td>plugin</td>
<td>stable</td>
<td>stable/Z2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Change 3</td>
<td>plugin</td>
<td>master</td>
<td>master/Z3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since the changes enter a DependentPipelineManager pipeline, Zuul creates
additional references:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="12%" />
<col width="14%" />
<col width="18%" />
<col width="57%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Change</th>
<th class="head">Project</th>
<th class="head">Zuul Ref.</th>
<th class="head">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>1</td>
<td>acme</td>
<td>master/Z1</td>
<td>acme master + change 1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>2</td>
<td>acme</td>
<td>master/Z2</td>
<td>acme master + change 1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>2</td>
<td>plugin</td>
<td>stable/Z2</td>
<td>plugin stable + change 2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>3</td>
<td>acme</td>
<td>master/Z3</td>
<td>acme master + change 1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>3</td>
<td>plugin</td>
<td>stable/Z3</td>
<td>plugin stable + change 2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>3</td>
<td>plugin</td>
<td>master/Z3</td>
<td>plugin master + change 3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In order to test change 3, you would clone both repositories and simply
fetch the Z3 reference for each combination of project/branch you are
interested in testing. For example, you could fetch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acme</span></tt> with
master/Z3 and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plugin</span></tt> with master/Z3 and thus have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acme</span></tt> with
change 1 applied as the expected state for when Change 3 would merge.
When your job fetches several repositories without changes ahead in the
queue, they may not have a Z reference in which case you can just check
out the branch.</p>

<div class="section" id="cross-repository-dependencies">
<h2>Cross Repository Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-repository-dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Zuul permits users to specify dependencies across repositories.  Using
a special header in Git commit messages, Users may specify that a
change depends on another change in any repository known to Zuul.</p>
<p>Zuul&#8217;s cross-repository dependencies (CRD) behave like a directed
acyclic graph (DAG), like git itself, to indicate a one-way dependency
relationship between changes in different git repositories.  Change A
may depend on B, but B may not depend on A.</p>
<p>To use them, include <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Depends-On:</span> <span class="pre">&lt;gerrit-change-id&gt;</span></tt> in the footer of
a commit message.  Use the full Change-ID (&#8216;I&#8217; + 40 characters).</p>
<div class="section" id="dependent-pipeline">
<h3>Dependent Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#dependent-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When Zuul sees CRD changes, it serializes them in the usual manner when
enqueuing them into a pipeline.  This means that if change A depends on
B, then when they are added to a dependent pipeline, B will appear first
and A will follow:</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img height="200" src="_images/blockdiag-06c51a7a8c033a1006065422fc439c49eddaf892.png" width="238" /></div>
<p>If tests for B fail, both B and A will be removed from the pipeline, and
it will not be possible for A to merge until B does.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If changes with CRD do not share a change queue then Zuul is unable
to enqueue them together, and the first will be required to merge
before the second is enqueued.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="independent-pipeline">
<h3>Independent Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When changes are enqueued into an independent pipeline, all of the
related dependencies (both normal git-dependencies that come from parent
commits as well as CRD changes) appear in a dependency graph, as in a
dependent pipeline. This means that even in an independent pipeline,
your change will be tested with its dependencies.  So changes that were
previously unable to be fully tested until a related change landed in a
different repository may now be tested together from the start.</p>
<p>All of the changes are still independent (so you will note that the
whole pipeline does not share a graph as in a dependent pipeline), but
for each change tested, all of its dependencies are visually connected
to it, and they are used to construct the git references that Zuul uses
when testing.</p>
<p>When looking at this graph on the status page, you will note that the
dependencies show up as grey dots, while the actual change tested shows
up as red or green (depending on the jobs results):</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img height="200" src="_images/blockdiag-5a92e7f62c4d31811055b37d56ef66a2b80cb9d9.png" width="238" /></div>
<p>This is to indicate that the grey changes are only there to establish
dependencies.  Even if one of the dependencies is also being tested, it
will show up as a grey dot when used as a dependency, but separately and
additionally will appear as its own red or green dot for its test.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-changes">
<h3>Multiple Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Gerrit change ID may refer to multiple changes (on multiple branches
of the same project, or even multiple projects).  In these cases, Zuul
will treat all of the changes with that change ID as dependencies.  So
if you say that change in project A Depends-On a change ID that has
changes in two branches of project B, then when testing the change to
project A, both project B changes will be applied, and when deciding
whether the project A change can merge, both changes must merge ahead
of it.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img height="280" src="_images/blockdiag-c23d053552e3c0ebeb1dee015f5855ac34294e47.png" width="238" /></div>
<p>A change may depend on more than one Gerrit change ID as well.  So it
is possible for a change in project A to depend on a change in project
B and a change in project C.  Simply add more <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Depends-On:</span></tt> lines to
the commit message footer.</p>
<div align="center" class="align-center"><img height="280" src="_images/blockdiag-b03d9e5d0d87252ccced0dd123a565f20d8b1504.png" width="238" /></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cycles">
<h3>Cycles<a class="headerlink" href="#cycles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a cycle is created by use of CRD, Zuul will abort its work very
early.  There will be no message in Gerrit and no changes that are part
of the cycle will be enqueued into any pipeline.  This is to protect
Zuul from infinite loops.</p>
