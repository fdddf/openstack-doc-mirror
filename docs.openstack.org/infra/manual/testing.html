<p>This document should give you a good idea of what you can count on
in the test environments managed by the Infrastructure team. This
information may be useful when creating new jobs or debugging existing
jobs.</p>
<p>Our test environment is currently set up in two buckets. The first is
made up of unprivileged single use VMs. The second are static VMs with
specific credentials giving jobs access to specific services. When your
jobs are started they will run on one of these two types of instances.</p>
<div class="section" id="unprivileged-single-use-vms">
<h2>Unprivileged Single Use VMs<a class="headerlink" href="#unprivileged-single-use-vms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The vast majority of your jobs will run here. These are single use VMs
booted in OpenStack clouds. You should start here unless you know you
have a reason to use a privileged VM.</p>
<p>Each single use VM has these attributes which you can count on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Every instance has a public IP address. This may be an IPv4 address
or an IPv6 address or maybe both.<ul>
<li>You may not get both, it is entirely valid for an instance to have
only a public IPv6 address and for another to have only a public
IPv4 address.</li>
<li>In some cases the public IPv4 address is provided via NAT and the
instance will only see a private IPv4 address. In some cases
instances may have both a public and a private IPv4 address.</li>
<li>It is also possible that these addresses are on multiple network
interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPUs are all running x86-64.</li>
<li>There is at least 8GB of system memory available.</li>
<li>There is at least 80GB of disk available. This disk may not all be
exposed in a single filesystem partition eg not all mounted at /.
Additional disk will be mounted under /opt.
To give you an idea of what this can look like most clouds just give
us an 80GB or bigger /. One cloud gives us a 40GB / and 80GB /opt.
Generally you will want to write large things to /opt to take
advantage of available disk.</li>
<li>Swap is not guaranteed to be present. Some clouds give us swap and
others do not. Some tests (like devstack-gate based tests) will create
swap either using a second disk device if available or by using a
file otherwise. Be aware you may need to create swap if you need it.</li>
<li>Filesystems are ext4. If you need other filesystems you can create
them on files mounted via loop devices.</li>
<li>Package mirrors for PyPi, NPM, Ubuntu, Debian, and Centos 7 (including
EPEL) are provided and preconfigured on these instances before starting
any jobs. We also have mirrors for Ceph and Ubuntu Cloud Archive that
jobs must opt into using (details for these are written to disk on the
test instances but are disabled by default).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these instances are single use we are able to give jobs full
root access to them. This means you can install system packages, modify
partition tables, and so on. Just about the only thing you can&#8217;t do is
reboot the instance as that will be interpreted by the job runner as
an infrastructure failure resulting in the job being rerun in a loop.
Keep this in mind if you intend on making changes to the system that
typically require a reboot, like updating your kernel. You will not
be able to reboot to accomplish that.</p>

<div class="section" id="static-privileged-vms">
<h2>Static Privileged VMs<a class="headerlink" href="#static-privileged-vms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These VMs are preconfigured with service account credentials and are
not deleted after jobs run on them. This allows you to have jobs that
write to AFS volumes, publish to PyPi, sign packages, or push code
back to Gerrit. The jobs that run here are much more tightly managed
as we cannot run arbitrary code on them. Generally though the above
assumptions for the single use instances hold here, with the exception
that these static instances are not single use, and jobs running here
do not get root access as a result.</p>

<div class="section" id="known-differences-to-watch-out-for">
<h2>Known Differences to Watch Out For<a class="headerlink" href="#known-differences-to-watch-out-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Underlying hypervisors are not all the same. You may run into KVM
or Xen and possibly others depending on the cloud in use.</li>
<li>CPU count, speed, and supported processor flags differ, sometimes
even within the same cloud region.</li>
<li>Nested virt is not available in all clouds. And in clouds where it
is enabled we have observed a higher rate of crashed test VMs when
using it. As a result we enforce qemu when running devstack and
may further restrict the use of nested virt.</li>
<li>Some clouds give us multiple network interfaces, some only give
us one. In the case of multiple network interfaces some clouds
give all of them Internet routable addresses and some others do
not.</li>
<li>Geographic location is widely variable. We have instances all across
North America and in Europe. This may affect network performance
between instances and network resources geographically distant.</li>
<li>Some network protocols may be blocked in some clouds. Specfically
we have had problems with GRE. You can rely on TCP, UDP, and ICMP
being functional on all of our clouds.</li>
</ul>
