Introduction
============

StoryBoard is a web application for task tracking across inter-related projects.
It is meant to be suitable for OpenStack task tracking.

StoryBoard consists of two components:
    * `Storyboard API service`_ - is a Python application leveraging
      `Pecan`_/`WSME`_ for REST API layer
    * `Storyboard Web Client`_ - is an all-javascript webclient for the
      Storyboard API
