<h1>Open Community<a class="headerlink" href="#open-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As one of four core tenets of OpenStack&#8217;s open mantra, an &#8220;Open Community&#8221;
is a critical and required component of an OpenStack project. Open communities
enable an open development environment, and are a key component of a successful
open source project. An OpenStack project should follow this model to ensure
its success and growth in the OpenStack ecosystem.</p>
<div class="section" id="public-meetings-on-irc">
<span id="irc-meetings"></span><h2>Public Meetings on IRC<a class="headerlink" href="#public-meetings-on-irc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenStack projects are required to have team meetings on the Freenode
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-irc"><em class="xref std std-term">IRC</em></a> network in one of the publicly logged team meeting
channels managed by the OpenStack infrastructure team. As part of
working in an open community, the logging of meetings allows those who
cannot participate at the meeting&#8217;s designated time to read the logs
and participate asynchronously.</p>
<p>Worth noting is the fact the OpenStack infrastructure team maintains a limited
number of meeting channels. The reason for this limitation is to force
teams to spread their meetings around. This allows for participation by people
all around the globe. It also allows people to attend multiple meetings where
otherwise they may have a conflict if we had a larger number of channels and
most meetings took similar timeslots.</p>
<p>To schedule a team meeting, please go to the <a class="reference external" href="http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/">eavesdrop</a> site and follow the
instructions there. All meeting reservations are managed through gerrit
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/irc-meetings/tree/">IRC meetings</a> repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-irc-channels">
<span id="irc-channels"></span><h2>Project IRC Channels<a class="headerlink" href="#project-irc-channels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenStack projects may have a team IRC channel on <a class="reference external" href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. These channels
<a class="reference external" href="http://governance.openstack.org/reference/irc.html">should be logged</a>, in keeping with the open community aspects of OpenStack.
Project teams typically congregate in their IRC channels to discuss the project
and build a sense of community amongst members. If a new project doesn&#8217;t yet
have critical mass, the channel #openstack-dev on Freenode is available to use
until such time as the project team decides to create their own channel.</p>
<p>Given the fact open source in general, and OpenStack in particular, are global
communities, IRC is a great way for the geographically disparate teams to work
together. Usage of IRC proxies (or bouncers) allow team members to access
messages that were sent while they are disconnected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mailing-lists">
<h2>Mailing Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#mailing-lists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenStack makes use of <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo">mailing lists</a> for communication. Much like IRC,
mailing lists are used to allow geographically distributed teams to communicate
and share information, in this case asynchronously. In addition to team
communication, mailing lists also provide an interaction point for
cross-project communication. If an idea needs to span projects, the mailing
lists is a great place for this to happen. And finally, mailing lists are used
to interact with non-developer community members of OpenStack.</p>
<p>When using the mailing list for team communication, it&#8217;s best to tag the
subject with the name of the project surrounded by brackets. For example,
to communicate something to the mailing list about Nova, you would add this
to the subject:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">nova</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are many mailing lists in the OpenStack ecosystem. Projects should ensure
they have subscribers on all of the lists relevant to their project.</p>
<p>Note that communications on OpenStack mailing-lists follow basic mailing-list
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/MailingListEtiquette">etiquette rules</a>. Getting familiar with those will make sure your messages
will have the desired impact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="community-support-channels">
<h2>Community Support Channels<a class="headerlink" href="#community-support-channels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a project in the OpenStack ecosystem, you will inevitably field requests for
support from users of your software. These can come in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bugs on <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/openstack">Launchpad</a></li>
<li>Mailing list requests</li>
<li>IRC message requests</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://ask.openstack.org/">ask.openstack.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A project must be prepared to provide best effort support for these types of
requests. Recommended courses of action include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Triaging bugs on <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/openstack">Launchpad</a> at least weekly.</li>
<li>Responding to project queries on the various mailing lists.</li>
<li>Working in-channel on IRC to answer questions.</li>
<li>Looking weekly at <a class="reference external" href="https://ask.openstack.org/">ask.openstack.org</a> for open queries related to your
project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planet-openstack">
<h2>Planet OpenStack<a class="headerlink" href="#planet-openstack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://planet.openstack.org/">Planet OpenStack</a> is a collection of thoughts from developers and other key
players in the OpenStack project ecosystem. If your project contains active
bloggers, it&#8217;s a good idea to make sure their blogs are listed here. This is a
nice way to provide an avenue of communication for developers in your project
to share their thoughts and ideas around the work they are doing throughout
the cycle.</p>
<p>To list your blog in the Planet OpenStack aggregator, follow the steps outlined

<div class="section" id="technical-committee-and-ptl-elections">
<span id="ptl-duties"></span><h2>Technical Committee and PTL Elections<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-committee-and-ptl-elections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All OpenStack technical leadership positions are elected. There are two types
of elected technical positions in OpenStack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Technical Committee (TC)</li>
<li>Project Team Lead (PTL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>project team</em> guide naturally focuses on PTLs. More information about the
TC can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="http://governance.openstack.org">Technical Committee website</a>. Each project team in
OpenStack needs a PTL. The PTL is an elected leader who has final say over
all things in that specific project team, and all the code repositories in it.
The PTL typically leads the day to day operations of the project, and acts as
a default ambassador of the project team in communications with other teams.
The PTL is expected to have sufficient time available to dedicate to running
the project. Responsibilities of the PTL include the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Organizing the content of the project team track in our Design Summits</li>
<li>Interacting with the release team in the #openstack-release IRC channel</li>
<li>By default participating in the weekly <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/CrossProjectMeeting">Cross Project meeting</a> and watching
the <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/q/project:openstack/openstack-specs">cross project repository</a>, unless a <a class="reference external" href="cross-project.html#cross-project-specification-liaisons">Cross Project Specification
Liaison</a> is assigned.</li>
<li>Maintaining cycle and development milestone plans. The dates for milestones
and releases are <a class="reference external" href="http://releases.openstack.org">posted</a> well in advance, make sure you have sufficient
free time on those special weeks.</li>
<li>Targeting and maintaining targeted bugs</li>
<li>Working with the release team on milestone delivery week, feature freeze,
release candidate weeks, and final release week</li>
<li>If an unexpected event occurs that doesn&#8217;t give you sufficient time to
dedicate to the items above, it is your responsibility to step down and allow
someone with more time to take over.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PTL for each project team is elected on a 6-month term. Thus, the project
will have an election every 6 months to determine the leader of the project
for the upcoming 6-month cycle.</p>
<p>Projects without any nominated PTL candidates during a specified period will be
considered leaderless and default to the technical committee for <a class="reference external" href="http://governance.openstack.org/resolutions/20141128-elections-process-for-leaderless-programs.html">decision</a>.</p>
<p>The electorate for elections (both PTL and TC) are the active contributors
to a project or projects. If your project is a git repository and all active
contributors submit patches to gerrit, their work will be automatically
acknowledged for elections. Should you have any contributors who support
your project in a way not reflected in gerrit, edit the extra-atcs file
in the openstack/governance repo.</p>
<p>OpenStack uses a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet</a> voting system for all Technical elections. This
includes both the TC as well as PTL positions. The elections are run by a
trusted team of election officials from the community who make election
announcements throughout the process, set up the election tooling and oversee
candidate and voter eligibility.</p>
<div class="section" id="tie-breaking">
<h3>Tie Breaking<a class="headerlink" href="#tie-breaking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Condorcet may result in ties, which should be broken in a fair and reproducible
manner. To this end, OpenStack uses the hash of a string describing the tie
results in a seed in a random generator to determine the tie winners. This way
anyone may verify the fairness of the tie break. For more details, see the
wiki page on <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/TieBreaking">tie breaking</a>.</p>
