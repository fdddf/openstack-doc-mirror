<h1>Stable Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#stable-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The stable branches are intended to be a safe source of fixes for high impact
bugs and security issues which have been fixed on master since a given release.</p>
<p>Stable branches are cut from the last release of a given deliverable, at the
end of the common 6-month development cycle.</p>
<div class="section" id="support-phases">
<h2>Support phases<a class="headerlink" href="#support-phases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Stability is always a trade-off between &#8220;bug-free&#8221; and &#8220;slow-moving&#8221;. In order
to reach that stability, we define several support phases.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It&#8217;s nevertheless allowed to backport fixes for other bugs if their safety
can be easily proved. For example, documentation fixes, debug log message
typo corrections, test only changes, patches that enhance test coverage,
configuration file content fixes can apply to all supported branches. For
those types of backports, stable maintainers will decide on case by case
basis.</p>
</div>
<p>Given that stable branches are created every 6 months, that means that at any
given time, only one branch is in Phase I support and only one branch is in
Phase II support. Depending on how long each branch is supported, there may be
one or more releases in Phase III support.</p>
<p>The exact length of any given stable branch life support is discussed amongst
stable branch maintainers and QA/infrastructure teams at every Design Summit.
It is generally between 9 and 15 months, at which point the value of the
stable branch is clearly outweighed by the cost in maintaining it in our
continuous integration systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appropriate-fixes">
<h2>Appropriate Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#appropriate-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Only a limited class of changes are appropriate for inclusion on the stable
branch. A number of factors must be weighed when considering a change:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The risk of regression: even the tiniest changes carry some risk of breaking
something and we really want to avoid regressions on the stable branch</li>
<li>The user visible benefit: are we fixing something that users might actually
notice and, if so, how important is it?</li>
<li>How self-contained the fix is: if it fixes a significant issue but also
refactors a lot of code, it&#8217;s probably worth thinking about what a less
risky fix might look like</li>
<li>Whether the fix is already on master and all consequent stable branches:
a change <strong>must</strong> be a backport of a change already merged onto master,
unless the change simply does not make sense on master. Same applies to N-2
releases, where N is master, in which case both N-1 and N branches should
have the patch merged.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Some patches may get exception from this last rule. These are patches
that do not touch production code, like test-only patches, or tox.ini
changes that fix major gate breakage, etc.; or security patches that
should not take much time to merge once the patches are published.
In those cases, stable patches may be pushed into gate without waiting
for all consequent branches to be fixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning" id="stable-modifications">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">In case review process reveals issues in the master patch which require
rework after stable patches are merged, it&#8217;s expected that additional
changes are merged into stable branches to avoid unneeded difference
between branches. So use the exception with due care.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="stable-maintenance-teams">
<h2>Stable maintenance teams<a class="headerlink" href="#stable-maintenance-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each project team should designate a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#Stable_Branch">stable branch cross-project liaison</a> as
the main point of contact for all stable branch support issues in the team.
If nobody is specifically designated, the PTL will be assumed to cover that
duty.</p>
<div class="section" id="project-specific-teams">
<h3>Project-specific teams<a class="headerlink" href="#project-specific-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each project with a stable branch will have a project-specific stable
maintenance team, which will be in charge of reviewing backports for a given
project, following the stable branch policy. Originally that group should be
the project Stable Branch Cross-Project Liaison + the stable maintenance core
team. Those groups are managed by the stable maintenance core team, names are
added after the suggestion of the Stable Branch cross-project liaison.</p>
</div>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/530,members">stable maintenance core team</a> is responsible for the definition and
enforcement of the Stable Branch policy. It will be granting exceptions for
all questionable backports raised by project-specific stable maintenance
groups, providing backports reviews help everywhere, maintaining the stable
branch policy (and make sure its rules are respected), educating proposed
project-specific team members on those rules and adding them to those
project-specific teams.</p>

<div class="section" id="active-maintenance">
<h3>Active Maintenance<a class="headerlink" href="#active-maintenance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Project-specific teams are expected to be actively maintaining their stable
branches which generally includes:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Following the <a class="reference internal" href="#review-guidelines">Review guidelines</a>. Specifically, not allowing backports of
new features, new dependencies, or backward incompatible changes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hint: if a project version has a cap in stable branch global-requirements
in stable/liberty or later, it means there was a backward incompatible
change which broke that stable branch. This generally applies to libraries
and client projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Proactively identifying and backporting significant bug fixes from master to
stable branches. This means the team is trying to get high impact bugs fixed
on stable before anyone hits them and has to report a bug or propose a
backport after the fact (after they already hit the issue in their
production cloud). There is no rule about how often or how many bugs found
and fixed in master should be backported to stable branches. The main idea
is to get regressions and other high-impact issues resolved on all
appropriate branches quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Monitoring the backlog of open backport reviews and actually reviewing them
in a timely manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Releasing frequently enough to get fixes out without overwhelming the release
team or consumers. In general, security fixes and other critical bug fixes
should be released quickly. Otherwise when there are a reasonable amount of
unreleased fixes committed, teams should be looking at doing a release.
Milestone boundaries during the master release schedule are also good times
to be inspecting the list of unreleased changes to see if a stable point
release should happen.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Monitoring and resolving issues in the continuous integration &#8216;gate&#8217; system.
This basically means making sure there aren&#8217;t things blocking proposed
backports from passing tests. These could be project-specific or global in
nature and are usually tracked in the <a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/stable-tracker">stable tracker etherpad</a>. From time
to time the Stable Maintenance Core team may also ask for help from
individual projects in IRC or the openstack-dev mailing list and expect a
reasonably prompt response.</p>

<h2>Review guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#review-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each project stable review team need to balance the risk of any given patch
with the value that it will provide to users of the stable branch. A large,
risky patch for a major data corruption issue might make sense. As might a
trivial fix for a fairly obscure error handling case.</p>
<p>Some types of changes are completely forbidden:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New features</li>
<li>Changes to the external HTTP APIs</li>
<li>Changes to Nova&#8217;s internal AMQP API</li>
<li>Changes to the notification definitions</li>
<li>DB schema changes</li>
<li>Incompatible config file changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed backports breaking any of the above guidelines can be discussed as
exception requests on the openstack-dev list (prefix with [stable]) where
the stable maintenance core team will have the final say.</p>
<p>Each backported commit proposed to Gerrit should be reviewed and +2ed by
two project-specific stable maintenance team members before it is approved.
Where a team member has backported a fix, a single other +2 is sufficient for
approval.</p>
<p>If unsure about the technical details of a given fix, project-specific stable
maintenance team members should consult with the appropriate project core
reviewers for a more detailed technical review.</p>
<p>If unsure if a fix is appropriate for the stable branch, project-specific
stable maintenance team members should seek stable maintenance core team
members opinion.</p>
<p>Existing core developers are greatly encouraged to join the stable maintenance
teams in order to help with reviewing backports, judging their appropriateness
for the stable branch and approving them.</p>
<p>Fixes for embargoed security issues receive special treatment. See the chapter
on vulnerability management for more information.</p>

<h2>Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenStack development typically has 3 branches active at any point of time,

and <em>oldstable</em> (previous release).  There can from time to time exist older
branches but a discussion around that is beyond the scope of this guide.</p>
<p>In order to accept a change into <tt class="code docutils literal"><span class="pre">$release</span></tt> it must first be accepted
into all releases back to master.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A change for <em>stable</em> must exist in master</li>
<li>A change for <em>oldstable</em> must exist in <em>stable</em> and <em>master</em></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>The current development branch (<tt class="code docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></tt>) will be the Uniform release.</li>
<li>The current <em>stable</em> branch (<tt class="code docutils literal"><span class="pre">stable/tango</span></tt>) was Tango and is now in

<h3>Proposing Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#proposing-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anyone can propose a cherry-pick to the stable-maint team.</p>
<p>One way is that if a bug in launchpad looks like a good candidate for
backporting - e.g. if it&#8217;s a significant bug with the previous release - then
just nominating the bug for a stable series (either <em>stable</em> or <em>oldstable</em>)
will bring it to the attention of the maintainers e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/kilo/+nominations">Nova Kilo nominations</a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have the appropriate permissions to nominate the bug, then tagging
it with e.g. <em>$release-backport-potential</em> is also sufficient e.g.
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bugs?field.tag=liberty-backport-potential">Nova Liberty potential</a></p>
<p>The best way to get the patch merged in a timely manner is to send it backported
by yourself. To do so, you may try to use the &#8220;Cherry Pick To&#8221; button in the
Gerrit UI for the original patch in master. Gerrit will take care of creating a
new review, modifying the commit message to include &#8216;cherry-picked from ...&#8217;
line etc.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The backport must match the master commit, unless there is a serious need to
differ e.g gate failure, test framework changed in master, code refactoring
or some other reason. If you get a suggestion to <em>enhance</em> your backport in
some way that would be contrary to this intent, the reviewer should be
referred to <a class="reference internal" href="#stable-modifications"><em>the warning above</em></a>.</p>

<div class="admonition note">

<p>To make sure suitable bug fixes that land in <em>master</em> branches are delivered to

<p>From high level perspective, proactive backporting process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>identify bugs fixed since the previous triage event;</li>
<li>of those, pick only those bugs that does not break stable policy policies;</li>
<li>distribute identified backport candidates among subteam members;</li>

<div class="admonition note">

<h3>Identify new bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-new-bug-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The process assumes that the subteam keeps track of the last git hash that was
validated somewhere. For the initial candidate list generation, it&#8217;s advised to
start on a branch boundary (the latest common git commit between <em>stable</em> and
<em>master</em> branches).</p>
<p>For every new git commit found in <em>master</em> branch, commit message is checked
for bug tags (Closes-Bug, Partial-Bug, Related-Bug, ...) All bugs mentioned are

<p>Once you are satisfied with the query result, you should remember the latest
commit checked, and also store the bug list somewhere.</p>
<p>To achieve the latter, multiple directions can be taken.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>One way is to store it in some external tool like Etherpad. If this
direction is chosen, the following tool may become handy to make the list
more consumable:</li>

<li>Another alternative is to tag backport candidates in Launchpad. For that,
it&#8217;s advised to avoid using <em>$release-backport-potential</em> tags, and instead
introduce a new tag per project team (f.e. <em>neutron-proactive-backport-potential</em>
for Neutron). This is to avoid conflicts in the tag usage by multiple teams
running independent backporting processes when bug fixes spanning multiple
projects are considered.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">|</span> ./lp-tag.py neutron-proactive-backport-potential
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command will tag all identified backport candidates with the project
specific tag. For example, check the <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bugs?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-importance&amp;search=Search&amp;field.status%3Alist=NEW&amp;field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&amp;field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&amp;field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&amp;field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&amp;field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&amp;assignee_option=any&amp;field.assignee=&amp;field.bug_reporter=&amp;field.bug_commenter=&amp;field.subscriber=&amp;field.structural_subscriber=&amp;field.tag=neutron-proactive-backport-potential&amp;field.tags_combinator=ANY&amp;field.has_cve.used=&amp;field.omit_dupes.used=&amp;field.omit_dupes=on&amp;field.affects_me.used=&amp;field.has_patch.used=&amp;field.has_branches.used=&amp;field.has_branches=on&amp;field.has_no_branches.used=&amp;field.has_no_branches=on&amp;field.has_blueprints.used=&amp;field.has_blueprints=on&amp;field.has_no_blueprints.used=&amp;field.has_no_blueprints=on">neutron proactive-backport-potential

<p>With that, you get access to all filtering features available in Launchpad.</p>

<h3>Distribute the work<a class="headerlink" href="#distribute-the-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you have a list of candidate bug fixes to consider for backporting, it&#8217;s
time to distribute it among subteam members. Depending on which method is
chosen above to track candidate bug fixes, you may utilize Launchpad search
queries, or other filtering technique to identify bugs of specific topics of
interest, to distribute the work to folks who are experts in those topics.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Exact search queries and filters are project specific and largely depend on
existing bug tracking practices adopted by projects. Hence they are out of
scope for the document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="candidate-triage">
<h3>Candidate triage<a class="headerlink" href="#candidate-triage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each candidate bug should be assessed on its applicability to <em>stable</em> and
<em>oldstable</em> branches, as per corresponding support phase definitions. For
example, for <em>stable</em> branch, all bug fixes of user value can be considered to
backport; while for <em>oldstable</em> branch, only critical bugs are allowed to be
backported.</p>
<p>For every applicable stable branch, a backport is proposed in Gerrit. The
backporter is expected to follow the progress of the backport to make sure it&#8217;s
not lost in reviews.</p>
<p>Once all applicable backports are proposed to Gerrit and are on their path
towards stable inclusion, <em>&lt;project&gt;-proactive-backport-potential</em> tag can be
removed from the bug.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If possible, consider keeping the order of backports in a way that would
reduce the number of git conflicts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-often">
<h3>Release often<a class="headerlink" href="#release-often" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Proactive backporting process is expected to trigger higher volume of changes
in stable branches. To make releases more granular, it&#8217;s advised participating
projects create new stable releases often. It may be done on a bi-weekly basis,
or any other schedule that fits better the project and its actual backports
volume.</p>
